Very similar to other courses. 

This one will have weekly tests from week 3 - 10 (8 total tests) which will give immediate feedback (worth 10%).

Finals will be in a CSE machine. Exam is a hurdle, so must pass (23+ / 55). Closed-book exam with limited online language documentation. Consisting of MCQs and Short Answer type questions similar to tutorial questions and approx. 6 programming type questions similar to labs in terms of style and difficulty.

Be regular with practice and always start everything as early as possible.
