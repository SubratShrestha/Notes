## OS.

The OS sits between the user and hardware, and it gives us a way for our programs to run on a virtual machine because its way more convenient than real machines.

When we get closer to the hardware, we may not have an OS for our programs and they may need to interact with the hardware directly, but most of our programs run on a virtual machine provided by the OS.

This was world changing because before this, every new hardware produced needed a different OS, and this was the great insight of unix and linux because these were one of the first OS's to be written in a high level language, it was a simple and powerful OS produced for one platform, a version of PDP Minicomputer and soon, it could be used in different PDP Minicomputers and soon, in multiple devices.

Now people could change hardwares, but stay on the same OS, and this was world changing. The OS's they produced (70s in Bell Labs), are still around today in androids and stuff.

OS's can also allow for privileges and more security.

The UNSW electrical engineering department bought a PDP 8 and knew of the new OS that had been written for these devices, and wrote to Dennis Ritchie for a copy in magnetic tape and they got it, and similarly with other universities, who developed different programs and additions to the OS to do more university specific things and these features were sent back to Bell Labs
