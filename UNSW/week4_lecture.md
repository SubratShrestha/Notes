## Maginot Line

Line of attack and defense contraptions built by France near Germany border just in case Germany went crazy. Took Germany 5 days to get through.

Wall took a lot of money and looked impenetrable

Goat analogy

don't build a defence system where the outside is super hard but the inside is vulnerable - a wall approach - m&m approach | super easy to explain, seems simple enough and its someone else's problem.

problem with walls is the single point of failure, also the people that the wall is defending will be stuck inside.

There have been many improvements to walls like multiple concentric walls, sloped base to prevent baterring ram, curved edges, etc etc. The Krak des Chavelier was the perfect wall and it took very little time for someone to get in. Someone just pretended to be someone else



Firefighters

If we list the occupation we trust the most, at the top there would be Nurses, doctors, firefighters, teachers, etc and near the bottom there would be bankers, politicians, etc.

The pattern we see is related to the motive behind the people in the profession.

Firefighters set the fires they put out, Nurses may kill children or the elderly, there's no drawing a line, you may build amazing walls around the house to protect our jewellery but the thief might be your own children or your wife, cops are amazing and they defend us but what about corrupt policemen.

Cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other birds and when the cuckoo hatches, they kick the other babies out.The parent birds still raise the baby, even to the point where the cuckoo baby is huge and the parents starve themselves to feed the "insider"

These examples are "insiders" that you trust and are inside the wall.



Why become an insider?

Greed, moral reasons, threatened/blackmailed, idiot, been planted, revenge, 



How do we deal with them?

insiders on the insiders, watch and monitor, system where threats from them are minimized
