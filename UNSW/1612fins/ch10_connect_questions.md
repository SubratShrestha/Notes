Q1. Manufacturer Limited is seeking a five-year term loan from its bank. The bank manager has indicated that a loan can be provided and will be priced at the bank's base rate, plus a margin. Which of the following is *least* likely to be a determinant of the margin to be paid by the company?



Multiple Choice

- The assets available to be pledged as security
- The term structure of interest rates ✅
- The borrower's past loan-repayment performance
- The debt to equity ratio of the borrower

## Explanation

The margin added to the bank's base rate will reflect the credit risk of the individual borrower. In assessing the risk and hence the margin, the bank is likely to consider factors such as the debt to equity ratio of the borrower and its past loan repayment performance. The term structure of interest rates is a market-wide factor and is likely to influence the *base rate*, but it would usually not have an influence on the *margin* that applies to a borrower.



Q2. A term loan agreement will usually specify a reference rate. Which of the following most accurately describes a reference rate?



Multiple Choice

- An average rate published daily
- An interest rate used as a benchmark for pricing loans ✅
- The interest rate payable by the borrower
- The prime rate set by a bank

## Explanation

The interest rate payable by a borrower will be equal to a reference rate, plus a margin.



Q3. In addition to interest charges, a term loan for a commercial borrower will usually involve a range of fees. Which of the following fees is *not* usually applicable?



Multiple Choice

- Commitment fee
- Establishment fee
- Application fee ✅
- Service fee

## Explanation

Commercial loans can involve a range of fees including establishment, service and commitment fees. Application fees typically apply to home loans, but they do not typically apply to commercial loans.



Q4. A term loan agreement may contain a bill option clause. Which of the following most accurately describes the effect of this clause?



Multiple Choice

- The borrower has the option to convert the loan to a bill facility.
- The borrower can use bank bills to repay the loan.
- The bank has the option to convert the loan into a bill facility. ✅
- The interest rate on the loan will be reset regularly, based on current interest rates on bank bills.

## Explanation

A bank may wish to have the flexibility to fund a loan from outside sources, rather than from its own base of deposits and other borrowings. A common way of achieving this flexibility is by inclusion of a bill option clause.



Q5. The repayments on a term loan can be structured in one of a number of ways. Which of the following is *not* one of the common repayment structures?



Multiple Choice

- Interest payments during the term of the loan, with the principal fully repaid at the end of the loan term.
- Deferred payment where repayments commence after a specified period.
- Regular periodic payments each consisting of interest plus part of the principal.
- Interest is capitalised and added to the principal until the end of the loan term. ✅

## Explanation

Lenders normally require regular payments comprising at least the interest on a term loan. While some deferral of the payments is possible, it would be very unusual to defer all the repayment until the end of the loan.



Q6.Loan covenants may be either positive or negative. Which of the following is a negative covenant?



Multiple Choice

- The borrower must maintain working capital of at least $1 million at all times.
- The borrower must provide audited accounts within 75 days of the end of each financial year.
- The borrower's dividends must not exceed 50 per cent of the profit. ✅
- The borrower must provide quarterly cash flow statements.

## Explanation

A positive covenant is one that specifies something that the borrower must do; whereas, a negative covenant specifies something that the borrower must not do.



Q7. Which of the following most accurately describes the meaning of technical default to a loan agreement?



Multiple Choice

- The borrower has failed to make a scheduled repayment.
- The borrower has failed to respond to a demand from the lending bank.
- The borrower has breached a loan covenant. ✅
- The borrower is late in providing its financial statements to the lender.

## Explanation

A borrower is in default if it has failed to make all scheduled repayments under a loan agreement. The term ‘technical default' is used to refer to the less serious case, where the loan repayments are up to date, but the borrower has breached a loan covenant.



Q8. Rags Limited is seeking a term loan from its bank to fund the purchase of a new cutting machine. The bank offers the company a $150 000 term loan, repayable by equal end-of-quarter instalments over a five-year period at a rate of 8.4 per cent per annum. Calculate the quarterly instalment amount payable by the company.



Multiple Choice

- $9262.27 ✅
- $12 982.96
- $15 958.09
- $7112.27

## Explanation

The quarterly interest rate is 2.1 per cent and there will be 20 instalments. The amount of each instalment can be calculated using Equation 10.1: *R* = \$150 000/[(1 – (1.021)-20)/0.021] = \$150 000/16.194729 = \$9 262.27.



Q9. Under a rental agreement with a regional shopping centre, Electronic Games Limited provides video game machines to the centre, and will receive monthly payments of $600 for the next four years. The company decides to sell its entitlement to these cash flows. Market yields are currently 12 per cent per annum. How much money will the company raise?



Multiple Choice

- $22 784.38 ✅
- $5870.79
- $1822.40
- $36 366.98

## Explanation

The amount of money raised can be viewed as the principal of a term loan and may be calculated by rearranging Equation 10.1 where *R* = \$600 and the interest rate is 1 per cent per month for 48 months. Thus, *A* = \$600[(1 – (1.01)-48)/0.01] = \$600 × 37.973959 = \$22 784.38.



Q10. Which of the following statements about mortgage loans is *not* correct?



Multiple Choice

- The mortgage market is the largest of the long-term debt markets in Australia.
- If the borrower fails to meet the terms of the loan, the mortgagor has the right of foreclosure. ✅
- Under a mortgage agreement the mortgagor conveys an interest in land to the mortgagee.
- Lenders in the Australian mortgage market include commercial banks, life offices, superannuation funds and finance companies.

## Explanation

A mortgage loan is one where the borrower has provided security by mortgaging an asset in favour of the lender or mortgagee. In the event of default, it is the mortgagee, not the mortgagor, who has the right of foreclosure.



Q11. Obtaining a mortgage loan may require taking out mortgage insurance. Which of the following most accurately describes the purpose of mortgage insurance?



Multiple Choice

- Mortgage insurance protects the borrower.
- Mortgage insurance allows the borrower to maintain loan repayments in the event of financial difficulty.
- Mortgage insurance protects both parties against the risk of a fall in the value of a property.
- Mortgage insurance protects the lender in the event that the borrower defaults. ✅

## Explanation

Mortgage insurance is usually required in cases where the amount of the loan exceeds a certain percentage, typically 80 per cent, of the value of the property that has been mortgaged as security. If the borrower defaults and the property is seized by the lender and sold, the net sale proceeds may be less than the loan amount outstanding. If that occurs, the mortgage insurer will make up any shortfall so that the lender does not incur a loss.



Q12. Borrowers can indirectly obtain funds through financial intermediaries or they can directly obtain funds by issuing marketable debt securities. Which of the following is *not* a significant reason for directly raising funds?



Multiple Choice

- Investors prefer to lend direct, rather than be exposed to the risk of bank failure. ✅
- Direct funding removes the cost of the financial intermediary.
- Borrowers who utilise a variety of funding sources can choose the most cost-effective source.
- Obtaining funds from a variety of sources reduces the risk for borrowers.

## Explanation

Investors who lend direct to a borrower by purchasing marketable debt securities are exposed to the risk that the issuer may default. This risk can be reduced by diversification across issuers but banks that lend to too many borrowers in different industries and different geographical areas are able to diversify more effectively than most individual investors. This is one reason why banks are able to offer very low risk deposits. In accordance, an investor who is concerned about default risk is more likely to deposit with a bank rather than lending direct.



Q13. Which of the following statements about debentures and unsecured notes is correct?



Multiple Choice

- A fixed charge can apply to assets of any type. ✅
- Unsecured notes are secured by a fixed charge and/or a floating charge over assets of the issuer.
- A floating charge can apply only to ‘permanent’ assets.
- The main difference between a debenture and an unsecured note is the form of security attached to the bond.

## Explanation

A fixed charge can apply only to assets that are ‘permanent’ as distinct from those that are routinely sold as part of the operation of a business.



Q14. Which of the following most accurately describes the source of the ‘crowding-out’ effect in financial markets?



Multiple Choice

- A higher level of government borrowing limits the funds available for business investment. ✅
- Government policies encourage investment in shares rather than in debt securities.
- Government policies favour indirect flows of funds through financial intermediaries.
- The government encourages funds to flow into superannuation.

## Explanation

The household sector is generally a net lender while the business sector is generally a net borrower. The government sector can be a net lender but it will be a net borrower at times—when the government's budget is in deficit. At these times, the government's borrowing requirements may be so large that it has the effect of pushing interest rates to levels that the business sector would prefer not to pay. This phenomenon is known as a ‘crowding-out' effect.



Q15. Which of the following best describes the essential difference between debentures and unsecured notes?



Multiple Choice

- Debentures are usually listed on a stock exchange, but notes are unlisted.
- Unsecured notes are issued as bearer bonds while ownership of debentures is recorded.
- Debentures are secured by a fixed charge, while notes are secured by a floating charge.
- Only debentures are secured by a charge over assets. ✅

## Explanation

Under the provisions of the *Corporations Act*, debentures must be secured by either a fixed or floating charge over assets. Unsecured notes are, as their name suggests, not secured.



Q16. In the typical securitisation process, which of the parties issues asset-backed securities?



Multiple Choice

- Service manager
- Credit enhancer
- Financial intermediary
- Trustee ✅

## Explanation

Several parties play a role in the securitisation process. The service manager is appointed to manage the associated cash flows. The credit enhancer is a highly rated institution (typically AAA) who helps to improve the credit rating of the issue. The trustee of the special purpose vehicle issues the new negotiable securities to investors.



Q17. Several methods may be used to issue debentures or unsecured notes. Which of the following is *not* one of those methods?



Multiple Choice

- Family issue
- Public issue
- Rights issue ✅
- Private placement

## Explanation

A rights issue is one where shareholders are entitled to take up additional shares, or securities that are convertible into shares, but not straight debt.



Q18. Issues of subordinated debt have been a popular way of raising funds for banks. Which of the following is a significant reason for this?



Multiple Choice

- Subordinated debt ranks ahead of debentures.
- Subordinated debt is an attractive, secure investment.
- Subordinated debt ranks ahead of all other liabilities of the issuer.
- Banks are allowed to include subordinated debt as capital for regulatory purposes ✅

## Explanation

Subordinated debt is ‘junior’ debt that ranks behind debentures and other senior liabilities of the borrower. Subordinated debt may be an attractive investment, but it is higher risk than most other debt and would not usually be described as ‘secure'. It is true that banks are allowed to include subordinated debt as Tier two capital and this is a significant factor that has encouraged them to raise funds by issuing such debt.



Q19. An institutional investor purchased $500 000 of debentures issued by Lipo Limited. The debentures pay a fixed coupon rate of 9.5 per cent per annum payable on a half-yearly basis. The debentures were issued with a term to maturity of seven years. Exactly one year has elapsed and the investor is concerned that Lipo is not progressing well and the investor decides to sell its investment in the company. Yields on such debentures have increased significantly to 14 per cent per annum. What is the price of the debenture?



Multiple Choice

- $688 638.80
- $401 613.48
- $410 644.78 ✅
- $320 149.12

## Explanation

The value of the debentures may be calculated using Equation 10.4. The amount of each coupon payment is $(500 000 × 0.095)/2 = $23 750 and 12 payments remain. The discount rate applicable to future cash flows is seven per cent per half year, so the present value is equal to:

\$23 750[(1 – (1.07)-12)/0.07] + \$500 000(1.07)-12

= \$188 638.80 + \$222 005.98

= $410 644.78



Q20. Which of the following statements about leasing is *not* correct?



Multiple Choice

- Essentially, leasing involves borrowing an asset rather than borrowing to buy the asset.
- Lease rental payments may be structured to reflect the cash flows generated by the leased asset.
- A prospective lessee should carefully calculate the after-tax cost of leasing.
- The main providers of lease finance are finance companies and merchant banks. ✅

## Explanation

Banks and specialist leasing companies are also significant providers of lease finance, so their exclusion makes this answer correct.



Q21. Mega Bank Limited and Toyo Finance have formed a partnership to purchase a Boeing 747 passenger jet. Over 80 per cent of the funding is in the form of loans from superannuation funds and other financial institutions. Aero Air Limited has entered into a long-term lease of the aircraft and will use it over the European summer. In the winter, the plane will be sub-leased to a carrier that operates in the southern hemisphere. The form of lease entered into by Aero Air, as lessee, may be described as a:



Multiple Choice

- direct lease.
- operating lease.
- leveraged finance lease. ✅
- sale and leaseback.

## Explanation

Since the lease entered into by Aero Air is long-term, it is almost certainly a finance lease. However, given that the lessor is structured as a partnership that has borrowed a high proportion of the funds needed to purchase the aircraft, it is classified as a leveraged finance lease.



Q22. FastPrint Pty Ltd needs an additional high-speed photocopier, which it plans to lease from the manufacturer, Opto Image Ltd. Under the terms of the lease, Opto Image will maintain and insure the copier. This type of lease arrangement is known as a:



Multiple Choice

- finance lease.
- direct lease.
- leveraged finance lease.
- full-service lease. ✅

## Explanation

Any lease provides finance but some leases provide additional services such as maintenance and insurance of the leased asset. Such leases usually involve the manufacturer or supplier of the asset acting as the lessor and are known as ‘full-service leases'.



Q23. Many providers of mortgage loans use securitisation. Securitisation may be most accurately described as:



Multiple Choice

- a technique that allows a portfolio of mortgage loans to be sold in return for funds raised by the sale of asset-backed securities. ✅
- a way of establishing a liquid secondary market in individual mortgage loans.
- a way of reducing the risk faced by lenders.
- a substitute for mortgage insurance.

## Explanation

Securitisation involves tradeable securities being issued in place of financial assets that are not tradeable. Securitisation always involves a group or ‘pool' of related assets.



Q24. The securitisation process involves several steps. Which of the following is *not* an accurate description of one of those steps?



Multiple Choice

- Financial assets such as housing loans are pooled together and sold into a special purpose vehicle controlled by a trustee.
- Loan repayments made by the original borrowers are used to pay interest and principal due on the new securities.
- The trustee issues new unsecured negotiable financial assets (securities) to investors. ✅
- A service manager will be appointed by the trustee to manage the various cash flows.

## Explanation

The new securities are backed by the original assets. In other words, the new tradeable assets are secured, not unsecured.



Q25. Which of the following statements about securitisation is correct?



Multiple Choice

- The main type of security issued by SPVs is the mortgage-backed bond.
- The SPV trustee usually arranges a stand-by facility to support its obligations to bond-holders.
- All of the answers provided. ✅
- The securities issued when mortgages are securitised may be bullet maturity mortgage bonds or principal pass-through bonds.



Q26. Banks provide term loans for a wide variety of purposes. Which of the following statements about term loans is correct?



Multiple Choice

- Lenders generally require security for a term loan.
- The major providers of term loans to businesses are finance companies.
- A term loan is generally repayable over 30 years.
- A term loan is often used to provide working capital. ✅

## Explanation

Term loans are typically secured and generally have terms of three to 15 years. They are available from a range of lenders including commercial banks, merchant banks and finance companies. Such loans are usually provided for the purpose of acquiring additional fixed assets such as land, buildings or plant and equipment, but they are not often used to provide working capital.



Q27. The interest rate on a term loan may be based on a market indicator rate or on a bank's own prime rate. Which of the following statements about these rates is correct?



Multiple Choice

- A prime rate only reflects the bank's borrowing costs.
- Prime rates are often more volatile than market indicator rates.
- For the borrower, the use of the prime rate concept has no real advantages.
- Prime rates tend to be less volatile than market indicator rates. ✅

## Explanation

The prime rates set by banks will reflect the banks' overhead costs as well as their borrowing costs. These rates tend to be less volatile than market indicator rates, which is an advantage for borrowers.



Q28. The covenants specified in a loan contract generally restrict the financial activities of the borrower. Which of the following is *not* a usual type of covenant?



Multiple Choice

- Minimum interest cover
- Maximum borrowings to tangible net worth
- Minimum dividend payout ratio ✅
- Maximum level of secured debt

## Explanation

The provisions in three of the answers are all covenants that might be found in loan contracts because their effects would be to protect the lender. Loan contracts might also include covenants related to dividends, but any such covenants would specify upper, rather than lower, limits on the level of dividends.



Q29. Service Company Ltd has been offered a term loan of $250 000 over five years at an interest rate of 8.8 per cent per annum. The loan will be repaid by equal quarterly instalments at the beginning of each month. What is the amount of each loan instalment?



Multiple Choice

- $15 250.35 ✅
- $12 500.00
- $15 520.35
- $15 585.86

## Explanation



The amount of each loan instalment may be calculated using Equation 10.2. The interest rate is 8.8/4 = 2.2 per cent per quarter and the term of the loan is 20 quarters. Using Equation 10.2, the amount of each quarterly instalment is:

*R* = \$250 000/[{(1 – 1.022-20)/0.022} × 1.022]

= \$250 000/16.3930696

= \$15 250.35



Q30. Fixed Assets Ltd issues five-year debentures with a face value of $2 million and a coupon rate of 8.5 per cent per annum payable on a half-yearly basis. The issue price is determined by a tender process, which results in the debentures having a yield to maturity of 7.8 per cent per annum. What amount is raised by the issue?



Multiple Choice

- $1 988 677.45
- $2 000 000.00
- $2 057 059.97 ✅
- $2 075 095.97

## Explanation



The amount raised by the issue may be found using Equation 10.4. The amount of each half-yearly coupon payment is $2 000 000 × 0.085/2 = $85 000 and the yield is 3.9 per cent per half year. Using Equation 10.4, the present value of the future cash flows is equal to:

*P* = \$85 000[(1 – 1.039-10)/0.039] + \$2 000 000(1.039)-10

= \$692 871.04 + \$1 364 188.93

= \$2 057 059.97



Q31. A corporate bond has a face value of $100 000. Coupon payments at the rate of 8 per cent per annum are due on 31 March and 30 September each year until 30 September 2012—when the bond matures. What is the value of the bond on 30 April 2008 if the yield is 10 per cent per annum?



Multiple Choice

- $92 892.18
- $98 320.05
- $100 000.00
- $93 638.14 ✅

## Explanation



In this case the price of the bond must be found between coupon dates. The price may be calculated using Equation 10.7. The approach is based on calculating the price at the previous coupon date, that is 31 March, and then compounding forward for 30 days to replace the price at 30 April. The amount of each coupon payment is $4000 and the yield is five per cent per half year. As at 31 March 2008, the bond has 4.5 years to maturity, so nine coupon payments remain after that date. At 31 March, the present value of the face value is:

$100 000(1.05)9 = $64 460.89. The present value of the remaining coupon payments is:

$4000[(1 – 1.05-9)/0.05]

= $4000 × 7.1078217

= $28 431.29 so the total present value at 31 March 2008 is:

\$(64 460.89 + 28 431.29) = $92 892.18

The period from 31 March to 30 April is 30 days and there are 183 days in the half-year from the start of April to the end of September. The final step is to replace the price at 30 April, which is equal to:

$92 892.18(1.05)30/183

= $93 638.14



Q32. The additional factors that need to be considered with cross-border leases include:



Multiple Choice

- foreign exchange risk resulting from lease cash flows.
- ensuring that arrangements are in place to recover the asset if the lessee defaults.
- the legal jurisdiction that will apply if legal action takes place.
- all of the answers provided. ✅

## Explanation

Cross-border lease arrangements require the consideration of a number of additional factors. This includes arrangements to recover the asset in case of default, management of foreign exchange risk and legal jurisdiction in case of legal action.



Q33. Sooky Ltd just obtained a loan at a rate of 12 per cent per annum to purchase a new computer system worth $100 000. Calculate how long it will take to repay the loan if equal monthly instalments of $5000 are made at the end of each month. (Note: answers are rounded up to the nearest month).



Multiple Choice

- none of the answers provided
- 20 months
- 21 months ✅
- 23 months

## Explanation

Q34. A company is seeking a fully-amortised commercial mortgage loan of $500 000 to finance a new project. Conditions attached to the loan include an interest rate of nine per cent per annum, payable over six years by equal monthly instalments being made at the start of each month. Calculate the amount of each monthly instalment.



Multiple Choice

- $9013
- $8853
- $9108
- $8946 ✅

## Explanation

Use Equation 10.3 with *A* = 500 000, *n* = 6 x 12, *i* = 9/12 to replace monthly payments.



Q35. Which of the following statements in relation to loan covenants is correct?



Multiple Choice

- Limitations placed on the amount of a dividend that can be paid to shareholders is a positive covenant.
- Covenants often restrict the off-balance-sheet activities of the borrowing company.
- A positive covenant limits or restricts the business activities or financial structure of the borrowing company. ✅
- A requirement that the borrowing company must maintain a minimum level of working capital is considered a positive covenant.

## Explanation

Any covenant that restricts the business activities is a negative loan covenant.



Q36. Which of the following is *not* correct in relation to mortgage finance?



Multiple Choice

- Bank lenders always require a borrower to take out mortgage insurance when the amount borrowed is greater than 60 per cent of the loan-to-valuation ratio. ✅
- While it is possible to obtain an interest-only mortgage loan, the interest-only period is normally for only part of the loan period.
- The largest portion of mortgage finance is for retail home loans.
- Commercial mortgages often have shorter term to maturity than retail mortgages.

## Explanation

The mortgagee may require the mortgagor to take out insurance up to 100 per cent of the property.

Q39. Determine the ranking of bond-holders in their claim on the company's assets in the event of default in terms of:

I. unsecured note holders.

II. floating charge debenture holders.

III. fixed charge debenture holders.



Multiple Choice

- II and III, then I
- III, followed by II then I ✅
- I, followed by II then III
- II, followed by III then I

## Explanation

The highest ranked bond holders have first priority, thus the fixed charge, then floating and last the unsecured holders.
