# Chapter 13: Interest rate determination

2 Approaches to interest rate determination: **macroeconomic context** and **loanable funds** approach.

# Determination of Interest

## Macroeconomic Context of interest rate determination

In most developed economies, monetary policy actions are directed at influencing interest rates. Monetary policy means adjusting the cash rate to control the inflation and this ultimately also controls the interest rates.

So by understanding what motivates a central bank in its implementation of interest rates policy:

* market participants (like investment banks) can anticipate changes in government's interest rate policy
* lenders and borrowers can make better informed decisions.



The Central bank may **increase** interest rates if there is:

* inflation that is above the target range (2%)
* excessive growth in GDP
* large deficit in balance of payments
* rapid growth in credit and debt levels
* excessive downward pressure on FX markets.

and increase in interest rates will:

* eventually increase long term rates
* slower consumer spending - reducing inflation and demand for imports
* decrease the size of current account
* possibly attract foreign investment, causing domestic currency to appreciate.



### Effects of changes in Interest rate

* **liquidity effect:**
	* effect of the central bank's market operations on the money supply and system liquidity

* **Income effect:**
	* if interest rates rise, economic activity will slow, allowing the rates to ease
	* increased rates also reduce spending levels and income levels.

* **Inflation effect:**
	* as the rate of growth in economic activity slows, demand for loans also slow
	* this results in an easing of rate of inflation.

* Its difficult to forecast the extent of liquidity, income and inflation effects on changes in interests, particularly when the business cycle is about to change, i.e is at a peak or trough.
* Economic indicators provide an insight into possible future economic growth and likelihood of central bank intervention. (Indicators like GDP, CPI, unemployment rates, etc.)
	* leading indicator: economic variables that change before a change in business cycle
	* coincident: at the same time as business cycle changes
	* lagging: after the business cycle changes.





## Loanable Funds approach

Loanable Funds (LF) are funds available in the financial system for **lending**.

Assumes a downward sloping demand curve and upward sloping supply curve in the loanable funds market, i.e.

* as interest rates rise, the demand for them falls (people don't wanna borrow from lenders that ask for high interest rates)
* as interest rates rise, the supply increases (all lenders want more interest, that's greater yield for them).



### Demand for LFs.

According to LF approach, the two sectors that demand LF are (Components of demand of LFs):

* Business demand for funds (B):
	* businesses want loans for short term working capital and longer term capital investment

* Government demand for loans (G):
	* To finance budget deficits and intra-year liquidity.

>
> as Interest rates (i) decreases, Businesses (B) demand more LFs. The effect on Governments (G) is less because whatever the government needs, it gets regardless of interest, because they need it. And so together, it makes the demand curve on the right.



### Supply for LFs.

According to LF apprach, three sectors that supply the LF (Components of supply of LFs):

* Savings of household sector ($S$)
* Changes in money supply ($M$)
* Dishoarding ($\Delta D$)
	* Hoarding is the proportion of total savings in economy held as currency (holding cash)
	* Dishoarding occurs (current holdings decrease) as interest rates rise and more securities are purchased for the higher yield available (holding/investing in securities).

> As interest rates rise, dishoarding rises and this makes sense because as interests rise,  more securities are purchased and dishoarding rises.

Combining Supply and Demand curves:

The Equilibrium point is $E$ and equilibrium rate is $i_{0}$ 

$E$ is a **temporary** equilibrium because the supply and demand curves are **not independent** (they depend on each other) and

* The level of dishoarding will change
* money supply is unlikely to increase proportionately in subsequent periods
* change in business and/or government demand 



### Impact of disturbances on rates

* Expected increase in economic activity
	* when the economy is expected to increase (people have a positve outlook), and businesses want to invest and produce more, and to do that they must borrow.
	* initial effect is that businesses sell securities, so more supply and the price decreases, so the yield increases and we say that dishoarding occurs.

* Inflationary expectations
	* the demand curve shifts to the right and the supply curve shifts to the left, resulting in higher interest rates and unchanged equilibrium quantity.



# Yields - term structure of interest rates

**Yield** is the total return on an investment comprising in interest received and any capital gain (or loss).
$$
Yield = \frac{sell - buy}{buy}
$$
The yield curve is a graph of yields on an identical security with different terms to maturity. 

Usually Yield curves are normal sloped or upward sloped and this makes sense because for longer terms, the borrower has more risk of the lender going bust. So usually for higher terms to maturity, the yield is high (higher risk compensated with higher yields).

**Term Premium** is the difference between the yield of a longer term to maturity bond and the yield of a shorter term to maturity bond, its basically the increase in yield an entity gets for the higher risk of longer term to maturity.

**spread** at some term to maturity is the difference between the yields of corporate bond to government benchmark bond yields, when spread is wider, its called (widening/cheapening/steepening/underperforming) of the bond and when the spread is closer together its the (tightening/richening/flattening/outperforming)

Corporate bonds are priced using a spread off the government benchmark bond yield curve so the yield curve indirectly regulates company funding.



## Expectations Theory

The **current short term** interest rate and **expectations** about the **future short term** interest rates are used to explain the shape and changes in shape of the yield curve.

Longer term rates will be equal to the avg. of the short term rates expected over the period.
$$
i_{long} = \frac{i_{short} + i_{Expec.\ short}}{2}
$$


Based on **assumptions** that:

* large no.of investors with reasonable homogenous expectations
* no transaction costs and no impediments to interest rates moving to their competitive equilibrium levels
* investors aim to max. returns and view all bonds as perfect substitutes regardless of term to maturity.

Explains shape of yield curve as:

* Inverse: result if market expects future short term rates to be lower than current short term rates
* Normal: result from expectations that future short term rates will be higher than current short term rates
* Humped: investors expect short term rates to rise in the future but to fall in subsequent periods.



## Segmented Markets Theory

Assumes securities in different maturity ranges are viewed by market part. as **imperfect** substitutes, rejects two assumptions of expectations theory

preferences of parts. are motivated by reducing risk of their portfolios, i.e minimizing exposure to fluctuations in prices and yields.

2 rejected assumptions are: bonds are not perfect subs. (pref. b/w short and long term) and investors want to reduce risk of portfolios.

Shape and slope of yield curve are determined by **relative demand and supply of securities along the maturity spectrum**

Ex. When the yield curve is normal (positive slope), and the Central Bank decides to sell its short term securities, the yield curve becomes inverse.

This is because when the bank sells its short term securities, the supply for them increases, and since supply increases, the price decreases, and since the price and yield of securities are inversely related, when price decreases, yield increases. So the yield of short term securities increase and so the curve is lifted on the short term end of yield curve above the long term end and so the yield curve becomes inverted. 

As segmented markets theory suggested, the relative demand and supply of securities determined the slope of the yield curve. 



So if the Central Bank increses the avg. maturity of bonds by **purchasing** short term bonds and **selling** long term bonds, the Segmented markets theory suggests that:

* short term yields Decrease, and long term yields Increase.
* the financial system liquidity is unchanged though, because Central bank is purchasing something and selling something else. The economic activity **is** changed though because:
	* short term interest rates will rise
	* long term interest rates will fall.
* Now the Expectations theory would suggest that since there's no effect on expectations about future short term interest, there should be no effect in the economy.



But the segmented markets theory denies the existance of investors seeking

* **arbitrage opportunities**: which are traders that want to profit from the differences in price of different markets.
* **speculative profit**: speculator's trading actions are dictated by **expectation**, not purely by demand and supply.



## Liquidity Premium Theory

Assumes investors have a preference for shorter term instruments because they have greater liquidity and less maturity and interest rate risk. So the investors need to be compensated for investing in longer term securites, and this compensation is the **liquidity premium**.

![image-20201027191229277](C:\Users\subra\Documents\Notes\UNSW\20T3\1612fins\ch11_interest_rate.assets\image-20201027191229277.png)

The formula from expected market theory then becomes
$$
i_{long} = \frac{i_{short} + i_{Expec.\ short} + L}{2}
$$
where L is the liquidity premium.



## What determines the Yield curve?

The LHS of the yield curve is manipulated directly by the Central Bank (RBA here, Federal reserve system in US).

The RHS or the long term yield is not determined by one thing, its more indirect, the long term yield drivers are:

* interest rate forecasts
* long term GDP growth estimates
* demographics
* demand for long term borrowing
* supply of long term lending
* especially inflation expectations.

Ex. So if bond investors expect that the central bank needs to raise the short term yield, bond investors will lift the yields on the long term end, but short term yields are still low because the central bank hasn't done anything. This results in a very **steep normal yield curve, which is a classic sign of an accelerating economy.** And similarly, **a inverted yield curve is a sign of a bad omen** (worry and fear). This has been tested multiple times and right before every crisis we can find an inverted yield curve. 

We can look at the **Term Premium** which is difference in yield of long term government bonds and short term government bonds. If the Term premium is negative - Icebergs ahead!

Long term bonds have greater risk than short term bonds, and so the term premium is the compensation for that risk, much like liquidity premium.

# Risk Structure of Interest rates

## Default Risk

Default risk is the risk that the borrower will fail to meet its interest payments.

The Commonwealth government bonds are assumed to have zero default risk as they are risk free and offer risk free rate of return.

Other borrowers are not the same, they have a greater default risk (ex. state government or private sector firms) so investors need compensation for the extra risk and we call that the **spread** or **Risk Premium** which is calculated as the difference between yields of the corporate and government bonds.

Treasury bonds are the benchmark.
