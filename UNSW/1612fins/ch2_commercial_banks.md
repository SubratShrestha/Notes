# Commercial Banks

# Main Activities.

More complex than they take deposits and invest those by making loans to customers. This is a large proportion of their activities, they provide a full range of financial services.

### Balance-sheet transactions

balance-sheet transactions are assets (e.g. loans), liabilities (e.g. deposits) and shareholders’ funds(equity).

### Off-balance-sheet transactions

Off-balance-sheet items are contingent liabilities; that is, they are transactions that do not appear on the balance sheet. 

For example, commercial banks have developed expertise in the provision of risk management products, using a range of over-the counter and exchange-traded derivative instruments. They also provide products and services that assist their customers to carry out import and export business.



They compete aggressively to obtain funds needed to provide loans and services. To provide loans, they forecast future loan demand to ensure they ave the funds available to meet the demand. As they lend millions in short-term, ensuring availability is critical. To do this they've moved from **Asset Management** to **Liability Management.**



### Asset Management

In the highly regulated banking sector, Asset management was the dominant practice. Because of regulations, banks restricted their loan activity (assets) to match the available amount of deposits received. It was uncommon for them to run out of funds for lending by the end of the month. It was expected that customers would come back next month to try again to obtain a loan.



### Liability Management

developed with the removal of restrictive regulation. It is the normal practice today. They now actively manage their sources of funds (liabilities) in order to ensure they have sufficient funds available to meet loan demand and other commitments. If loan demand is forecast to increase (assets are forecast to increase), banks enter the capital markets and borrow the necessary funds required to meet their forecast loan demand. Banks are no longer dependent on their deposit base for lending. They manage their liability base by borrowing directly from the domestic and international capital markets. As the major banks typically have high credit ratings, they are able to borrow substantial amounts, especially within the international capital markets.

# Sources of Funds.

Where does the bank obtain the funds that it lends??

In order to attract the savings of surplus entities, commercial banks offer a range of instruments with different terms to maturity, liquidity, rates of return and cash-flow attributes.

The main sources of commercial bank funds are:

* Current Account Deposits 
* call or Demand Deposits
* term deposits
* negotiable certificates of deposit
* bill acceptance liabilities
* debt liabilities
* foreign currency liabilities
* loan capital and shareholders’ equity



## Current Account Deposits

Liquid funds held in cheque account; cheques drawn to purchase goods and services.

One of the most liquid instruments offered by a bank. Funds helod in cheque account facility. The current account holder able to write order on cheque instructing bank to pay funds to the name payee.

Even though curent account deposits are liquid, they provide a stable source of funds for banks because they can be used to pay for goods and services. Dynamics of an economy means individuals and businesses are continually transacting goods and services so current account deposits are always being maintained, thereby creating an ongoing funding source for the banks.

Business checque account reffered to as operating account, used by a business to pay periodic expenses. A checque account will generally pay low interest. The level of interest reflects highly liquid nature of current account deposits. 

This is like the everyday account at ANZ.



## Call or Demand Deposits

Funds held in savings account that can be withdrawn on demand.

Generally referred to as savings accounts, they usually receive low interest payments. Low interest represents highly liquid nature and low risk.

Banks typically charge transaction and account service fees on them, the low rate of return combined with transaction costs discourage customers from maintaining too much in this account. They've historically represented stable source of funds fro banks. This derives from individual's collective desire to hold some funds in an account that can easily be used to meet forecast expenses and unexpected emergencies.



## Term Deposits

Funds lodged in an account for a predetermined period and at a specified fixed interest rate. They receive fixed interest for the period. Saver nominates term to maturity - 1 month to 5 years.

Higher return than current or call deposits compensates saver for loss of liquidity. Often used as investment alternative for surplus funds that are not required immediately.

Safe and stable investment attractive to conservative investor, popular in countries with ageing population who seek secure investments. History shows times of volatility means savers revert to safe haven of the bank term deposit.



## Negotiable Certificates of Deposit

Discount security issued by a bank, referred to as CD.

Issued by bank undertaking to pay bearer the face value of CD at maturity - up to 180 days. Different from other forms of deposit, in that bank may issue it directly into the money market. CDs dont include any interest, and sold by the bankto an investor at discount to face value.

Ex. face value of 180-day CD is 100,000, buyer must pay 96,755.38. On maturity, holder will receive 100,000 on presentation of CD to bank. Such investment would represent return 3,244.62 = yield of 6.80 per cent per annum.

CDs are Negotiable securities bec. there is a deep and liquid secondary market for CDs, original purchaser can sell it at any time up to maturity.

yield on new CDs can be adjusted quickly as funding requirements change - rate of return can be changed from one transaction to another which is not easily achieved on the more standard bank deposits, they have become imp. in liability management approach of banks.



## Bill Acceptance Liabilities

Short-term money-market discount security whose face value repayable at maturity.

A business may seek to raise funds through **bill of exchange**, and a bank may take 2 roles in the bill - act as acceptor or may discount the bill. If bank takes the acceptance role, then the bill is "bank-accepted bill".

A bill is a discount security, and in order to encourage investors to buy the bill, they may ask bank to accept the bill. The acceptor, on behalf of the issuer, will repay the face value of bill at maturity. By acting as acceptor, bank increases creditworthiness of bill, and bank will have separate arrangement in place to ensure they recover funds at maturity. Ofc, bank charges fee for this service.

Bank may also agree to discount and buy the bill from issuer. Rather than hold the bill to maturity, bank is most likely to sell (re-discount) bill immediately to money market. In this situation, bank incurred a liability on balance sheet because of the acceptance commitment ie. agreement to repay face value at maturity. By sellng bill into money market, bank able to arrange finance for its business customer without having to use its own funds.



## Debt Liabilities

Discussed domestic money-market instrument (CD) above, but majority of bank's assets are longer-term loans, thus banks must acitively borrow in capital markets in order to fund part of their lending.

**Medium to long-term instruments issued by banks are debentures, unsecured notes and transferable certificates of deposit.**

**Debentures** and **unsecured notes** are bonds issued by corporations, including banks that pay a regular interest - fixed or variable coupon to holder, usually semi-annually or annually. Principal repaid at maturity. They are bonds with a form of security attached. The security for bank-issued debenture is usually a collateralised floating charge - if borrower defaults, lender will take possession of borrower's assets. Unsecured note is a bond without securities

Transferable certificates of deposit are long-term fixed-rate instruments typically issued with min. face value of 100,000 with terms to maturity of 3-5 years.



## Foreign Currency Liabilities

Debt instruments issued into international capital markets denominated in another currency.

Deregulation opened up opportunities for banks to expand activities and fund balance sheets from international sources ex. deregulation included floating of exchange rate of major currencies, opening up foreign exchange markets and removal of most restrictions on floa of capital in international markets.

Large capital markets are important source of foreign current liabilities. Banks find it easier to raise substantial amounts of debt in international cap markets, often at a net lower cost than in traditional transaction-based depositor base. 

ex. Major Australian banks ((National Australia Bank, Westpac Banking Corporation, Commonwealth Bank and ANZ Banking Group) periodically issue debt instruments into international cap markets to raise amounts ranging from 500m to 1b which is used over the next 3-6 months to fund demand for loans.

International debt issues are typically denominated in foreign currency. The types of debt issued are the same as those issued in domestic markets and include discount securities, medium-term notes, debentures and unsecured notes.

Globalisation means bank's major corporate clients have become more internationalised, increasing business demand for financial services denominated in the currencies of their transactions. That demand provides a further reason for banks to seek foreign currency liabilities.



## Loan Capital and Shareholder's Equity

Sources of funds that have characteristics of both debt and equity, described as "loan capital" or hybrid securities. Ex. bank may issue subordinated notes, subordinated meaning the holder will only be paid interest payments or have the principal repaid after the entitlements of all other creditors have been paid.

Banks are listed corporations, ie. institution issues equity securities such as ordinary shares that are quoted on a stock exchange. Also banks typically generate profits from their business activities. Some of profit paid to shareholder as dividends, some kept as retained earnings, increasing shareholder's funds. Equity is an imp. source of long-term funds for banks. In fact, banks are req. by the bank regulator to hold minimum levels of equity (capital).

# Uses of Funds

Funds used by banks appear as assets on their balance sheets. The majority of bank assets are assets that create an entitement to future cash flows, ex. bank gives customer a loan, the amount outstanding on loan will appear as assets because bank is entitled to receive periodic interest payments plus repayment of principal. We can categorise commercial bank assets into:

* personal and housing finance
* commercial lending
* lending to government
* other bank assets



## Personal and Housing Finance

### Housing.

Housing Finance is the provision of long-term funds to enable the purchase of a residential property. Its where the bank registers a mortgage - form of security whereby a lender registers an interest over the title of a property. This is an attractive form of lending as the risk of default by borrower is normally low. In theory, borrowers try and meet housing loan commitments bec. if they don't, bank will take possession of house and sell it to recover owing amount.

Commercial banks have traditionally dominated residential housing loan market but new providers of housing finance have entered like insurance offices and superannuation funds, increasing competition. **Mortgage originators** - specialist providers of housing finance - have also grown in deregulated market.

Banks and mortgage originators use securitisation for lending acitivities, this is when lender may seek to obtain additional funds to provide new housing loans by selling existing housing loans. Its descirbed as selling of a class of assets, such as housing loans into a trust. The trustee, to raise funds to pay for purchase of these loan assets, will issue new securities to investors, these securitiesmay be bonds that are secured by the housing loans held in the trust. Investors like the securities because under normal circumstances, they are lower risk assets. The trustee will use the interest and principal payments due from the housing loans held in the trust to pay interest and repay principal on the new securities issued.

Term of housing loan varies considerably b/w countries. Major determinant of termis avg. cost of housing coupled with level of interest. In countries where property prices are high, term will be longer, if this wasn't true, people would not be able to afford to repay loan commitments. The repayment schedules also differ, typical owner-occupied loan will require regular **amortised loan instalments** - regular and equal loan instalments that comprise the current interest and part repayment of outstanding principal - over the loan period. Banks offer loans with either fixed or variable interest, but fixed will usually be reset every 5 yrs or less. The interest on variable loans will move from time to time acc. to market.

Another form of housing finance is investment property finance where the bank provides funds to investor who buys property for rental or lending purposes. Again, bank will take registered mortgage over property as security for loan.



### Personal.

Banks can provide people with a **fixed-term loan** where the loan will have a term to maturity of up to 5 yrs. As with housing finance, interest rates may be fixed or variable, and the bank req. some form of security like a guarantee.

Banks also provide **personal overdraft** facilities, which allows someone to put an account into debit (take money out) from time to time up to an agreed limit. People often need to manage the mismatch in timing of cash flows (income), and the personal overdraft allows them to pay expenses when they are due by putting the overdraft account into debit. Bank expects that the overdraft will be brought back to credit when the person receives income.

A more flexible alternative to overdraft is the **credit card** which can be used for electronic transactions like using ATMs or EFTPOSs by drawing on predetermined credit limit provided by issuer (bank). The bank will allow card user to draw against credit limit. Credit cards typically have high interest on used credit, and range of transaction and other fees may also apply.





## Commercial Lending

Represents bank assets invested in business sector plus lending to other institutions. Lending to business is essential for economic growth which generates benefits such as increased production, higher level of employment and better living standards in a country.

Since only corporations with good credit can raise funds through direct finance, most businesses borrow from intermediaries and Commercial banks are the principal lenders. Larger corporations still borrow from banks, but they can also borrow directly from the markets.

Main type of loan is **Term loan** with maturities from 3 - 7 years. Businesses can negotiate terms and conditions with bank, and they include the period, interest, security, and timing of interest payments and repayment of principal.

Banks offer short and long term loans which may be based on fixed interest rate or variable set to a specified reference interest rate which is a benchmark rate, ex. **BBSW** in Australia is the Bank Bill Swap Rate which is the average mid-point of bank's bid and offer rates in bank bill secondary market.

Banks also offer businesses Overdraft facilities and the main purpose is to enable a business to manage mismatches in the timing of its cash flows. Businesses often need to pay out funds for expenses before receiving funds back from their business, and the overdraft allows them to borrow the funds it needs. The overdraft is repayable upon demand and so needs to be managed carefully. Banks will charge fees and interest for this very flexible funding arrangement. 

Banks also discount commercial bills (buy for less than face value), which are bills of exchange issued to raise finance for a business, and are discount securities. The banks generally sell the discounted bill into the money market, but they can hold them as assets and are described as Bank Bills Held. These commercial bills are normally drawn for terms like 30 to 180 days, and in order to extend the overall term of this short-term instrument, banks may provide a customer with a **rollover facility** which is an arrangement where a bank agrees to discount new securities over specified period as the existing securities mature. 

Ex. if a business has issued 90-day bills with a two-year rollover facility, the customer is able to redraw new bills every 90 days for the next two years. When the new bills are drawn, the yield on the bills will change to reflect current rates in the market. This means the bills are re-priced every 90 days, thus protecting the bank from the risk that interest rates might change. The bank bills money market is deep and liquid. This allows banks the flexibility initially to provide funding to business borrowers by discounting bills, but with the option to sell those bills easily into the money market to generate more funds for further lending.

Another category of bank finance is **leasing** and that's when the asset is borrowed. Its an arrangement where the owner of an asset (lessor) allows another party (lessee) to use that asset subject to terms and conditions of lease contract. A bank, as lessor, will finance the purchase of an asset and will enter into arrangement with lessee where lessee will make lease payments in return for use of the asset.



## Lending to Government

Banks lend to government directly by investing in government-issued securities such as Treasure bonds an other public sector securities. They als provide some leans to government agencies in form of term loans and overdraft facilities.

Governments need short-term funds to meet regular commitments like social security benefits and salaries of government employees, and long-term funds for capital expenditures like building hospitals and stuff. If the timing of taxation and other income receipts does not cover intra-year expenses, governments issue short-term securities like **Treasury Notes** - which are short-term discount securities issued by the government - to raise short-term funds. Longer term expenditures are funded through **Treasury Bonds** which are medium to long-term securities issued by the government that pay regular half-yearly interest, and principal repaid at maturity.

Governments are low risk low return securities, so why would banks invest in them? Multiple reasons.

Advantages of lending to government:

* Investment alternative for surplus funds that a bank is holding.
* source of liquidity because easily sold in secondary markets.
* provide income streams and capital gains
* may be used as collateral to support the bank's own borrowings in direct finance markets.
* may be used for repurchase agreement with central bank in order to raise cleared funds for payments system settlements.
* improve the quality of balance sheet by holding a group of assets (govt. paper) with lower risk attributes.
* enable a bank to manage marturity structure of balance sheet by purchasing securities with range of maturities and cash flows.
* allow a bank to manage interest rate risk by buying/selling securities with different interest rate structures

So lending to government through purchase of govt. securities provides bank with flexibility to actively manage its overall asset portfolio, while lowering overall risk.



## Other Bank Assets

Lending is the core business and the largest allocation of assets, but they accumulate range of assets like receivables, shares in and loans to controlled entities, goodwill property, plant and equipment and unrealised gains from tading activities in derivative products.

# Off-balance-sheet Business

Noted at the beginning of the chapter that banks undertake a substantial volume of business that, by its nature, is not recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. Such off-balance-sheet transactions represent an important source of income for the banks, and are most important in the financial life of businesses and governments.

Main types of off-balance-sheet business conducted by commercial bakns are:

* **Direct Credit Substitutes**

* **Trade- and performance-related Items**

	involve the bank in supporting or guaranteeing the obligation of a client to a third party (both direct credit and trade- and perfomance related).

* **Commitments**

	Relate to a bank's contractual obligations to customers that are yet to be completed.

* **Foreign Exchange, interest rate, and other market-rate-related Contracts.**

	contracts involve the use of derivative products to manage risk of banks and its customers.



## Direct Credit Substitutes

Direct Credit substitutes are provided by banks to support a client's financial obligations. Bank does not provide finance from its own balance sheet. The direct credit substitutes ensures that the client is able to raise funds directly from the markets.

Ex. direct credit substitute may take form of stand-by letter of credit. This is an undertaking by bank to make payment to specified third party if the bank's client fails to meet financial obligation to that third party. With undertaking, client is able to issue securities and raise funds directly in the markets, since lender is assured that amounts due will be repaid by either borrower or the bank. This sounds similar to a bank-accepted bill but the bank accepted bill is an instrument, but a letter of credit is a mechanism. The letter will set up the conditions that are to be met in order for payment to take place, but the bill is an instrument where seller can discount the bill with the bank and receive payment (bill is discount security).

Other direct credit substitutes include guarantees, indemnities, and letters of comfort issued by a bank that have the effect of guranteeing fin. obligations of a client.

Ex. a bank's client when submitting tender docs. for major construction project may need to provide formal assurance that it has the fin. capacity to complete the project. It would be expected that if the client wins the tender, bank will provide finance for the project.



## Trade and Performance related Items

Also guarantees made by bank on behalf of its client, but in this case, they are made to support a client's non-financial contractual obligations which may include trade-related undertakings or contractual agreements to provide goods or services. In these circumstances, bank provides guarantee on behalf of client that it will make payment to third party subject to terms of specific commercial contract.



### Documentary letters of Credit (DLCs)

These are where bank substitutes its credit standard for that of client. The bank, on behalf of client, will authorise payment to a named party against delivery by that party of a shipment of goods.

Ex. an exporter of goods will usually req. the importer to arrange for its bank to provide a DLC to exporter's bank. Once the imported goods arrive, the associated documents are inspected and payment is made b/w banks immediately. The DLC is irrevocable, cannot be cancelled.



### Perfomance guarantees

These are where bank agrees to provide fin. compensation to third party if client does not complete the terms and conditions of a contract. 

Ex. client may be deemed to have failed to complete the terms of contract if inferior components are used in a major computer system upgrade.



## Commitments

They are contractual fin. obligations of bank that are yet to be completed or delivered. These involve a bank in an undertaking to advance funds to a client, or to underwrite debt and equity issues, or to purchase assets at some future date.

Examples of commitments:

* **Outright forward purchase agreements** are where a bank contracts to buy a specified asset like foreign currency from its client at an agreed exchange rate on a specified date.
* **Repurchase agreements**. A bank sells assets like govt. securities, on the understanding that bank will repurchase them at a specified date.
* **Underwriting facilities** is when a bank guarantees a client that, subject to range of conditions, it will cover any shortfall in funds received from a primary market issue of debt or equity securities.
* **Loans approved but not yet drawn down**. Ex. bank has agreed to provide borrower with loan at a future date upon completion of loan documentation.
* **Credit card limit approvals that have not been used by card holders**. Ex. bank may authorise a credit card limit of \$4000 for a client. If client uses \$1000 of available credit, then that amount will appear on balance shet as asset (loan) and the remaining \$3000 credit remains as off-balance-sheet commitment.



## Foreign exchange, interest rate and other market-rate related Contracts

These involve the use of derivative products like futures, options, swaps and forward contracts. Primarily designed to facilitate hedging - implementing strategies to protect against an identified risk - against risk, ex. the effects of movements in exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices and commodity prices. 

Derivative contracts are also bought and sold by traders in an attempt to make profits from movements in contact prices. Examples of these include:

* **Forward exchange contracts** where a bank contracts to buy or sell at a future date a specified amt. of a foreign currency at an exchange rate that is set today.
* **Currency swap** where a a bank exchanges principal amt. and ongoing associated interest payments that are denominated in a foreign currency.
* **Forward rate agreements** is a compensation agreement b/w bank and client based on notional principal amt. One party compensates the other if interest rates move above or below an agreed rate.
* **Interest rate futures contracts** are exchange traded agreements to buy or sell a specific security at a specific price at a predetermined future date.
* **Interest rate options contracts** provide the right, but not obligation to buy/sell a specified instrument at an agreed date and price.
* **Equity contracts** include futures and options contracts based on specified stock prices or stock indices. These lock in the equity price today that will apply at a specified future date.



## Volume of Off-balance-sheet Business

In Australia, the face value of bank's off-balance-sheet business in 2017 stood at \$37.34 mil. while the total valur of bank's assets stood at \$4.125 mil. i.e the notional value of off-balance-sheet business is 9 times the value of total assets (notional value of many derivative products is significantly greater than actual associated cash flows).

The nature and size of market-rate-related contracts, combined with volatility and speed at which contracts are re-priced in the market has resulted in a no. of extraordinary losses being incurred by both institutions and their clients.

The threat to stability of domestic and global fin. systems that may result from large losses in derivatives markets has been subject of much descussion by regulators.

Of course, during the GFC a number of institutions, including Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, collapsed as the direct or indirect result of excessive trading in mortgage-related derivatives. In the end, it is the responsibility of each bank to ensure that it establishes and documents objectives, policies and procedures in relation to its use of derivative products.





# Regulation and prudential supervision of Commercial banks

Regulation directly influences structure, scope, and scale of fin. institutions, instruments and markets.

A banking sector regulatory and supervisory framework should:

* ensure a framework that is able to adjust regulation to maintain the cost effectiveness of a fin. system in a dynamic environment.
* provide focused and accountable structure that facilitates community expectations for consumer protection and fin. safety.
* provide efficient and effective regulation of multinational fin. conglomerates.
* establish consisten regulation and competitive neutrality across fin. system.
* contribute to effective monitoring and review with aim of establishing more sontestable, efficient and fair fin. markets.

Area of concern for regulators is maintaining soundness and stability of fin. system, and ensuring savers have confidence in commercial banks as safe repositories for funds.

Bank regulation no longer rely heavily on prescribing asset composition of bank's balance sheet, but imposes guidelines allowing banks wide range of options in lending decisions, but forces banks that have higher-risk lending strats. to support their activities with higher amts. of capital or shareholder's funds.

In some countries, central bank acts as banking sector regulator and supervisor, in others, central bank responsible for stability of fin. system and soundness of payments system, while separate authority responsible for regulation and supervision of institutions, for Australia:

* Responsibility for maintenance of fin. system stability and soundness of payments system - central bank (Reserve Bank of Australia)
* Prudential regulation and supervision of deposit-taking institutions (comm. banks, building socs, and credit unions), insurance offices, super funds, etc - APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority).
* Regulation and supervision of market integrity and consumer protection within context of Corporations Act, 2001 - ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission).
* Matters of competition policy (Competition and Consumer Act 2010) - ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission). Within this, govt. has implemented 'four-pillars' policy which restricts mergers b/w big four comm. banks in Australia.

APRA's approach is that bank's sound operation rests with its own management and board, but there are some aspects of banking operations where APRA is more intrusive and implement prudential guidelines and standards, like with the imposition of min. cap. requirements.

In event of threat to stability of fin. system, RBA resp. for determining whether, and how it might provide emergency liquidity support to fin. system. RBA does not regard its balance sheet as available to support solvency of individual fin. institution that may experience fin. difficulty. Each comm. bank must rely on strength of its own balance sheets.





# Background to Capital Adequacy Standards

Capital is cornerstone of bank's fin. strength acc. to APRA. Balance sheet of banks include range of assets funded from liabilities (loans) and shareholder's funds (referred to as capital). Main assets of banks are loans to customers, perc. of loans will default and this is written off against profits, but if losses  > profits, written off against capital and not liabilities bec. they need to repaid. 

Capital has important functions:

* source of equity funds for corporation
* demonstrates shareholder's commitment to org.
* enables growth in business and source of future profits.
* necessary to write off periodic abnormal business losses. 

Deregulation and globalisation, coupled with rapid advances in tech and development of sophisticated fin. products created environment in which there was potential for instability and failure of global fin. system.

Governors and central banks of major insdustrialised countries meet monthly at Bank of International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland established committee in 1974 known as Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Even in 70s, committee recognised prblems involved in regulating internationally diversified banks and recommended that those banks should be treated on globally consolidated basis but should come primarily under regulatory powers of home country.

Committee presented paper to governors of central banks expressing concern aboutn erosion of bank's capital bases and recommended thse to be rebuilt. Committee wanted to develop framework that would maintain soundness of international fin. system that would allow banks to make their own portfolio choices and promote greater competitive equality b/w banks in international markets.

Developed Basel I capital accord, adopted by most countries, it applied standardised approach to measurement of capital adequacy of banks, and was successful in increasing amt. of capital held and created strong foundation to support stability of global fin. system, but became apparent that Basel I didn't fully account for diversity, sophistication or innovation of changing fin. markets. Committee conducted major review and culminated Basel II.

Basel II adopted by bank regulators. Basel III guidelines released in 2010, its goal is to make institutions more resilient to economic shocks that occur in economic system that is characterised by fin. institutions that don't hold reserves that match their liabilities. Basel III initially proposed enhancements to quantity and quality of bank's capital reserves, liquidity ratios and leverage ratios, these were reviewed over time, framework was finalised in December 2017.





# Evolution from Basel I to Basel III
