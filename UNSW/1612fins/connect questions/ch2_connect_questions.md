# Chapter 2: Connect Questions

Q1 Which of the following statements about bank term deposits is correct?

* Commercial banks typically offer term deposits for periods greater than five years.
* The interest rates on term deposits are usually higher than the rates on call deposits. ✅
* Term deposits are usually attractive to investors who require frequent access to their funds.
* The interest rate on a term deposit usually varies over the period of the investment.
* Explanation
	Term deposits require investing at a fixed rate for a fixed period of time (with penalties for early withdrawal). They are therefore less liquid than call deposits so a higher rate of interest is needed to compensate investors for the loss of liquidity.



Q2 Banks have progressively moved from asset management to liability management. Which of the following statements best describes liability management?

* The deposit base and other funding sources are managed to fund loan demand and other commitments. ✅
* The deposit base is managed in order to fund loan demand.
* The ratio of debt to equity is managed to meet capital adequacy requirements.
* Banks are able to access only the domestic capital markets to fund their liabilities.
* Explanation
	A bank that focuses on asset management may replace that its lending is constrained if the growth of its deposits is not sufficient to fund all the loans that management wishes to make. Instead of declining profitable loan requests, a bank may adopt liability management whereby the bank will actively seek additional funds from deposit and non-deposit sources in order to meet the demand for loans. Banks are able to access both domestic and international capital markets, and for many Australian banks the proportion of offshore capital used is significant.



Q3 Banks and other depository institutions can raise funds from many sources. Which of the following are fund sources utilised by banks?

I. Call deposits

II. Certificates of deposit

III. Treasury notes

IV. Loan capital

* I, II, III
* I, II ✅
* I, II, IV
* I
* Explanation
	Of the four items listed, three are fund sources used by banks, namely call deposits, certificates of deposit and loan capital, which includes subordinated notes. Only the Commonwealth Government issues Treasury notes.



Q4 An important distinction between current deposits and call deposits is:

* only call deposit accounts pay interest to the depositor.
* banks charge transaction fees on current accounts but not on call deposit accounts.
* call deposits are more liquid than current deposits.
* only current deposit accounts have a cheque facility. ✅
* Explanation
	For the purpose of preparing official banking statistics a distinction is made between funds in accounts that have cheque facilities and those in other similar accounts without cheque facilities. Funds in accounts with cheque facilities are known as ‘current deposits’. Deposits that can be withdrawn on demand from accounts without cheque facilities (such as savings accounts) are classified as ‘call deposits’. Both call and current deposit accounts can pay interest and incur transaction fees; current deposits are regarded as more liquid than call deposits (given the ability to withdraw by cheque).



Q5 An important source of funding used by banks is the certificate of deposit (CD). Which of the following statements about CDs is correct?

* CDs differ from other bank deposits in that they are issued at a discount from face value. ✅
* While CDs are transferable, sales in the secondary market are rare.
* The yield offered on new CDs is reviewed on a weekly basis by each bank.
* CDs are essentially the same as retail term deposits except that larger amounts of money are involved.



Q6 Which of the following does not represent a ‘use of funds’ by commercial banks?

* Certificates of deposit ✅
* Commercial bills
* Overdrafts
* Credit cards
* Explanation
	Uses of funds by banks include discounting commercial bills, lending on credit cards and providing overdrafts. Issuing certificates of deposit is a source of funds, not a use of funds.



Q7 Lending to government by banks mainly takes the form of the purchase of government-issued securities. The reasons why banks invest in these securities include:

I. regulations require banks to hold government securities.

II. government securities are a primary source of liquidity for banks.

III. government securities provide yields that are higher than the returns on other investments.

IV. government securities allow a bank to manage its interest rate sensitivity.

- I, IV

- I, II, IV

- III, IV

- II, IV ✅

- Explanation

	Of the four reasons listed, I and III are incorrect—the regulations under which banks were required to hold government securities have been abolished and the yields on government securities are lower than the returns on most other investments.



Q8 The main type of loan provided by Australian banks to commercial borrowers is:

* bill rollover facilities.

* lease finance.

* overdraft facilities.

* fixed-term loans. ✅
* Explanation
	Historically, Australian banks met the needs of businesses largely by providing overdraft facilities. However, providing overdrafts can be costly for banks, who have discouraged their use by imposing higher interest rates and a range of additional fees. As an alternative to overdrafts, banks have encouraged commercial borrowers to use fixed-term loans and these now account for the majority of lending to businesses.



Q9 In Australia, the largest form of bank lending to individuals is:

- fixed-term loans for the purchase of motor vehicles.

- 
	loans for the purchase of owner-occupied housing. ✅

- investment property finance.

- credit card finance.
- Explanation
	All four types of bank lending are used by individuals in the Australian market, but the total value of loans for home purchase is considerably greater than that of the other three types.



Q10 Using total assets as a measure of size, the largest group of institutions in all major financial systems is:

- insurance companies.

- 
	merchant banks.

- 
	commercial banks. ✅

- superannuation funds.

- Explanation
	The banks' share of the total assets of all financial institutions varies between countries and over time but, using Australia as an example, it is between 40 and 50 per cent, which is clearly the largest share held by any of the institutions.



Q11 The off-balance-sheet business of banks is categorised below. Which category represents the most significant proportion of total off-balance-sheet business of the banks?

- Commitments

- 
	Direct credit substitutes

- 
	Trade and performance-related items

- Market rate-related transactions ✅
- Explanation
	Instruments such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, both of which are in the marker rate-related category, dominate off-balance-sheet business.



Q12 A basic principle of APRA's approach to prudential supervision of banks is that:

- prudential supervision allows the regulator to control interest rates.

- 
	the primary responsibility for a bank's sound operation rests with its own management and directors. ✅

- prudential supervision continues to rely on restricting the composition of banks' balance sheets.

- 
	depositors' funds are protected by a government guarantee.

- Explanation
	The RBA is responsible for controlling interest rates and that is quite separate from the prudential supervision carried out by APRA. Prudential supervision does not extend to providing a government guarantee to protect deposits. Bank regulation used to involve controls on interest rates and restrictions on the composition of their assets but those restrictions have been removed.



Q13 APRA has introduced specific capital requirements for Australian banks. Banks are required to have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 10.5 per cent in which type of capital?

- All of the answers provided

- 
	Subordinated debt

- 
	General loan-loss reserves  ✅

- Retained earnings

- Explanation
	APRA is phasing in a requirement that Australian banks have a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1), consisting of the highest quality capital, of at least 10.50 per cent. Retained earnings accrue to common equity and so meet the criteria. The other two types of capital are classified as Tier 2 and so do not meet the quality of capital required by APRA.



Q14 Which of the following statements best describes the regulatory structure of the Australian financial system?

- Banks, superannuation funds and life insurance companies are each supervised by separate regulators.

- 
	APRA is responsible for the overall stability of the financial system and of individual institutions.

- 
	The overall stability of the financial system and of individual institutions is the responsibility of the Reserve Bank.

- There are several regulators but each is responsible for its own distinct area of regulation. ✅
- Explanation
	The Reserve Bank is responsible for the overall stability of the financial system, while APRA supervises individual institutions within the system. The institutions listed are all supervised by APRA. The framework is based on the principle that only one regulator should be responsible for each type of regulation.



Q15 If an individual bank experiences financial difficulties, leading to a threat to the stability of the Australian financial system, then:

- the Reserve Bank is obliged to provide emergency liquidity support.

- 
	management of the bank experiencing financial difficulties is solely responsible for achieving a solution.

- 
	APRA has primary responsibility for dealing with the problem.

- the Reserve Bank will determine whether, and how, it might provide emergency liquidity support. ✅
- Explanation
	APRA is responsible for the prudential supervision of financial institutions. It is true that APRA takes the approach that the ‘primary’ responsibility for each bank's sound operation rests with its own management and directors. This does not mean that regulators would refuse to intervene in a crisis. If difficulties experienced by an individual bank threatened the stability of the financial system, then the problem would become the responsibility of the Reserve Bank. While the Reserve Bank has responsibility in such a case, it is not ‘obliged’ to attempt a rescue—it could decide that the bank in difficulty should be allowed to fail.



Q16 The Basel I capital accord, which applied a standardised approach to the measurement of the capital adequacy of banks, was later extended. Under the extended version of Basel I, which of the following is the most accurate?

- The capital base that each bank must have depends on the credit risk of its on- and off-balance-sheet assets.

- 
	All banks must have capital equal to at least 8.00 per cent of their assets.

- 
	The capital required depends on a bank's exposure to market risk as well as credit risk. ✅

- The capital that each bank must have depends only on the credit risk of its on-balance sheet assets.

- Explanation
	The Basel I capital accord initially specified that banks must hold capital equal to at least 8 per cent of their risk-weighted assets, so the focus was on credit risk. Basel I was later extended to also include a bank's exposure to market risk.



Q17 The Basel II accord is regarded as a major extension of Basel I. Which of the following most accurately describes the way in which Basel II extends Basel I?

- It is more sensitive to the different levels of risk that may exist in an institution. ✅

- It introduces a measure of the risk of off-balance-sheet business.

- 
	It introduces new restriction on the risky assets that banks may hold.

- 
	It introduces a measure of market risk.

- Explanation
	A major criticism of the Basel I capital accord is that the risk weights applied to assets are based on categories that are too broad. For example, all loans to companies have a risk weight of 100 per cent regardless of the credit rating of the borrower. Basel II provides for the risk weights to be aligned more closely with the actual risk involved and this change.



Q18 Prudential supervision of banks relies on capital adequacy standards. The main reason for reliance on standards related to the level of bank capital is:

- banks need to raise capital to generate profits.

- 
	every business requires some shareholders' funds.

- 
	the standards restrict the financial leverage of banks. ✅

- accounting principles require that loan losses must be written off against capital.

- Explanation
	While several roles can be identified for bank capital, the primary reason for reliance on capital adequacy is that it provides an effective way of restricting financial leverage. A higher ratio of capital to assets means that the ratio of liabilities to assets is lower. In turn, this means that the risk of insolvency, through an unexpected decline in the value of assets, is lower if the ratio of capital to assets is ‘high'. ‘The standards restrict the financial leverage of banks' is the correct answer: while all other statements are valid, none of them constitute the main reason for reliance on capital adequacy standards.



Q19 Mega Bank advances a loan of $5 million to a company that has a Standard and Poor’s credit rating of A+. How much of the loan can be funded by liabilities?

- $4 800 000 ✅

- $4 600 000

- 
	$4 920 000

- 
	$200 000

- Explanation
	Table 2.3 shows that a rating of A+ is an external rating of 2, and this attracts a risk weighting of 50 per cent. The amount of capital required is Loan value × Risk weight × 8% = $5 million × 0.5 × 8% = $200 000. The remaining balance of $4 800 000 can be funded by liabilities.



Q20 A bank may choose to measure its market-related, off-balance-sheet capital requirements using a value at risk (VaR) model. APRA requires a VaR model to apply a confidence level such that, on average, trading losses from market-related contracts will exceed the VaR estimate:

- one in every 100 trading days. ✅

- one in every 50 trading days.

- 
	one in every 100 trading weeks.

- 
	between one and five times in every 100 trading days.

- Explanation
	A VaR model may be used to estimate the maximum potential gains or losses that may occur with a specified probability over a given time period. Where such models are used in relation to off-balance-sheet, market-related contracts, APRA requires a 99 per cent confidence level based on a one-day holding period.



Q21 Banks may issue securities classed as ‘loan capital’. Which of the following statements about loan capital is correct?

- Some types of perpetual loan capital are recognised by regulators as part of bank capital for capital adequacy purposes.

- 
	All of the answers provided. ✅

- Subordinated debentures may be included in loan capital.

- 
	Loan capital refers to instruments that have characteristics of both debt and equity.

- Explanation
	In addition to raising funds by accepting deposits and by borrowing, banks can issue securities such as perpetual subordinated debt and other hybrid securities. Such securities are classified as loan capital and are shown in Table 2.2. Some of these securities can be included in bank capital for regulatory purposes.



Q22 Several factors have contributed to growth in the importance of foreign currency liabilities as a source of funds for Australian banks. The relevant factors include:

I. deregulation of the foreign exchange market.

II. offshore funds are always less costly than local borrowings.

III. diversification of funding sources.

IV. avoidance of local bank regulations.

- I, IV

- 
	I, III ✅

- all of the answers provided.

- 
	II, III

- Explanation
	If a bank's deposits are not sufficient to fund all its profitable loans, the bank will usually raise additional funds by borrowing from the financial markets rather than declining requests for loans. In some cases, a bank may be able to raise all the needed funds in the local market but many Australian banks have raised large amounts in offshore markets and these borrowings are generally denominated in a foreign currency. Of the four ‘reasons’ given, all are valid except II and IV. Offshore funds may be cheaper than local funds in some cases but if this was always so then, logically, a bank should raise all of its funds from the cheaper source, so II is not valid. Bank regulations in many countries are very similar and do not distinguish between local and foreign currency fund sources, so IV is also invalid.



Q23 In addition to day-to-day liquidity needs, banks face special liquidity problems. The best explanation for this is:

- the maturity structures of bank assets and liabilities are mismatched. ✅

- the liquidity requirements imposed by regulators are difficult to meet.

- 
	future cash flows and hence liquidity requirements are uncertain.

- 
	banks have a high proportion of their funds invested in illiquid real assets such as premises and computers.

- Explanation
	Banks and other financial intermediaries offer short-term deposits while providing long-term loans. In other words, the term to maturity of their assets is greater than that of their liabilities. Banks face potential liquidity problems if an unexpectedly high proportion of depositors seek to withdraw their funds at, or around, the same time. Regulatory requirements must be achievable. Future cash flows are, of course, uncertain but this is not peculiar to banking. Finally, premises and computers are illiquid but they make up only a very small proportion of bank assets.



Q24 Setting limits on maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities and access to wholesale markets for the issue of money market securities are both strategies that banks can use to:

- manage liquidity. ✅

- implement liability management.

- 
	meet capital requirements.

- 
	control credit risk.

- Explanation
	The maturity mismatch between bank assets and liabilities is one reason for the potential liquidity problems faced by banks. It follows that setting limits on the extent of the mismatch is one tool that can be used to manage bank liquidity. Another useful measure is to make arrangements in advance, whereby the bank can raise cash by accessing lines of credit or issuing securities.



Q25 Which of the following statements about the off-balance-sheet business of Australian commercial banks is correct?

- Off-balance-sheet business is fairly evenly divided across the four main categories.

- 
	The face value of off-balance-sheet business is considerably larger than the total value of bank assets. ✅

- The face value of off-balance-sheet business is an unbiased measure of its significance relative to on-balance-sheet assets.

- 
	The face value of off-balance-sheet business is similar to the total value of bank assets.

- Explanation
	Based on 2010 figures the face value of off-balance-sheet (OBS) business was about six times the total value of bank assets. OBS business consists largely of derivatives and their face values are typically many times larger than the eventual cash flows. Market-rate related OBS business is far larger than the other three categories.



Q26 Which of the following statements regarding the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of Basel III is correct?

- The LCR aims to encourage long-term stability by requiring funding via stable sources.

- 
	The LCR is the ratio of a financial institution’s high quality assets to net profits.

- 
	The LCR has the aim of providing a buffer to help financial institutions survive brief periods of acute financial stress. ✅

- Banks are required to maintain a LCR of no more than 100 per cent.

- Explanation
	The LCR aims to ensure that financial institutions hold high quality liquid assets (HQLA) in sufficient volume to sustain them for a period of one month during a period of ‘acute stress’. The net stable funding ratio (NSFR) has the aim of providing long-term stability. LCR is computed as the ratio of HQLA to net cash outflows and not profits, and the ratio must be at least 100 per cent.



Q27 Banks can be viewed as essentially passive receivers of deposits that are used mainly to fund loans. In Australia, this traditional view of banks:

- applies to most, but not all, banks.

- 
	is inaccurate as a description of modern bank operations. ✅

- remains an accurate description.

- 
	has never been valid.

- Explanation
	Accepting deposits and making loans (financial intermediation) continues to be a core activity of banks. However, banks are not ‘passive' and actively seek new business opportunities and funds from sources other than deposits. Modern banks are involved in foreign exchange transactions, insurance, funds management and derivatives as well as financial intermediation. In other words, they provide a full range of financial services so the description in the question is inaccurate.



Q28 In recent years, banks have undertaken an increased volume of business that is not recorded as assets and liabilities in their accounts. This type of business is generally known as:

- over-the-counter business.

- 
	commercial bill transactions.

- 
	exchange-traded contracts.

- off-balance-sheet business. ✅
- Explanation
	Commercial bill transactions do give rise to assets and liabilities that appear on a bank's balance sheet. Business conducted by banks that is not recorded as assets and liabilities includes dealing in over the counter and exchange traded derivative contracts but the general term for all such business is ‘off-balance-sheet business'.



Q29 Why is mortgage lending a large part of a bank’s loan portfolio?

- Mortgage loans are safe because house prices never decline.

- 
	There is a large demand for mortgage loans.

- 
	Banks are the only lenders of mortgage loans.

- Banks are required to hold less capital for mortgage loans than for other loan types. ✅
- Explanation
	There are many reasons why banks are major lenders for mortgage finance. Capital requirements give a lower risk weighting to mortgage loans and so this means banks are required to hold less capital, reducing their costs. There is a large demand for mortgage loans, but banks would only supply those loans if they could profit from doing so. Mortgage loans are viewed as relatively safe but house prices do decline from time to time (e.g. during the GFC). In recent years a number of other non-bank loan providers have entered the mortgage market.



Q30 Bill acceptances are recorded as liabilities on the balance sheets of banks. These liabilities arise from:

- banks selling bills into the financial markets.

- 
	banks guaranteeing that the holder of a bill will be paid at maturity. ✅

- banks making a commitment to purchase bills if and when a customer needs to issue them in the future.

- 
	banks purchasing bills in the open market.

- Explanation
	When a bill of exchange is issued, it must be ‘accepted' by a bank or other financial institution. The acceptor takes on the primary responsibility for paying the face value of the bill to the holder on the maturity date. In other words, the acceptor provides a guarantee so that it is the credit rating of the acceptor that determines the risk of the bill.



Q31 The bank bill swap rate (BBSW) is most accurately described as:

- an important reference rate used to determine the interest rate charged on bank loans. ✅

- the interest rate on bank term deposits.

- 
	the interest rate on bank overdrafts.

- 
	the interest rate on fixed term loans.

- Explanation
	The interest rates on bank loans are typically set by adding a margin or premium to a base or ‘reference' rate. In the case of floating (variable) rate loans the interest rate is adjusted at specified intervals based on movements in the reference rate. For commercial loans in the Australian market, the most commonly used reference rate is the BBSW.



Q32 The largest providers of housing loans in the Australian market are:

- banks. ✅

- superannuation funds.

- 
	mortgage originators.

- 
	building societies.

- Explanation
	Most of the larger building societies that used to exist in Australia have converted to banks so the building society sector is now very small. While new entrants to the home loan market, such as mortgage originators, have achieved market share, banks have retained their dominant position in the market.



Q33 Why do banks like to provide bank accepted bill facilities

- They are highly liquid.

- 
	All answers are correct. ✅

- They can sell them if they require funding.

- 
	They are negotiable facilities.

- Explanation
	All the answers point to the fact that the bank is able to negotiate bank bills relatively easily and can sell them if necessary for funding.



Q34 Credit substitutes and performance guarantees are both seen as similar types of commitments. The major difference between them is that performance guarantees are:

- credit related while credit substitutes are non-credit related.

- 
	off balance sheet while credit substitutes are on balance sheet.

- 
	non-credit related while credit substitutes are credit related. ✅

- on balance sheet while credit substitutes are off balance sheet.

- Explanation
	Both performance guarantees and credit substitutes can be seen as guarantees. However, credit substitutes are viewed as guarantees for loans and performance guarantees are seen as guarantees for non-credit circumstances such as rental leases



Q35 XYZ Ltd requires a bank loan that will allow it to manage small short-term and seasonal variations in its cash flows. The type of loan that is designed for this purpose is a:

- term loan.

- 
	lease.

- 
	bill rollover facility.

- overdraft. ✅
- Explanation
	An overdraft provides the type of flexibility that is needed in this case. Once an overdraft facility has been established, the borrower can draw on additional funds as required (provided the approved limit is not exceeded). Also, cash inflows can be used to repay part of the loan at any time but there is no set repayment schedule to adhere to.



Q36 Value at risk (VaR) models are seen as fundamental to the prudential supervision. The problem with VaR is:

- the use of historical data.

- 
	all answers are correct. ✅

- it assumes a normal distribution.

- 
	it assumes liquid markets.

- Explanation
	VAR models became a problem during the GFC when their deficiencies became apparent. These included the assumption of normality, liquid markets and the use of historical data. In essence all the options are deficiencies.



Q37 Liquidity management is about ensuring:

- cash is available today.

- 
	cash is available in the near term. ✅

- cash is always available.

- 
	is not about cash.

- Explanation
	The prudential guidelines are very clear about the aim of liquidity management. It is the management of cash in the near term (now 30 days).



Q38 Lending to government can be an important use of bank funds. The most likely way that the Australian government would borrow to fund long-term budget capital expenditure is via:

- overdrafts.

- 
	Treasury bonds. ✅

- term loans.

- 
	Treasury notes.

- Explanation
	If the timing of taxation and other income receipts does not cover short-term expenses then the government may issue short-term securities such as Treasury notes or in exceptional cases make use of an overdraft. Longer term financing could involve a term loan, but it is more typical for governments to issue a Treasury bond.
