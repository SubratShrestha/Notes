* its unethical to lie to the court

* section 80 of the Legal profession uniform conduct (barristers) rule states that if the client confesses guilt, but maintains
  a plea of not guilty, the barrister MUST not set up an affirmative case inconsistent with the confession.

* if every barrister continues to defend someone that's guilty is inefficient - time and money - for white collar money laundering crimes,
  it reduces fair and transparent market, encourages corruption and culture of 'covering'

* above the duties of a barrister, they have an OVERRIDING duty to the court and justice.

	* counter for untrustworthy lawyers: for the public image of lawyers, they cannot be only seen covering crime up



# Security through obscurity

Doom level design

So I was watching the developers of the popular game - Doom - react to someone speed running (speed running is when someone plays the game with the intention to finish it in the shortest time - usually by exploiting glitches and loopholes) through it and it brought out a really nice example of security through obscurity.

 Usually with speed runs, players use every glitch they can find and they usually find quite a few.

The speed runner was flying through most of the levels by using a 'jump trick' where his character would trap itself in a corner and keep pressing the jump button and the physics engine of the game would count all the jumps into the character's eventual jump height and for some reason this would all take effect in one massive jump when the character got out of the corner - effectively making it jump way past most of the levels.

Physics glitch and exploiting a basic function aside, the player managed to jump to an area the developers were using for testing, and in this area, there was a special weapon that could basically make the game a cakewalk. The devs put this testing area where no 'normal' player could ever get to - a secret area.

But through the exploit, this player could get up there, get the weapon and basically annihilate everything in the game with ease.

The reaction of the devs are super funny -

"He found the room. JERRY!!"

"IT WAS BRANDON!"

Shows how expecting everything to run smoothly and expecting all users to do things the 'normal' way is never a good idea, and expecting security by putting in 'secrets' isn't so effective because eventually, secrets come out and if the whole system relies on this secret being kept a secret, then the whole system is compromised.
