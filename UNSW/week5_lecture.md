# Privacy

privacy involves secrets, so secrets arent inherently bad



## Data

who watches the watcher? The data isnt good or bad, but who and why people use data can be good or bad.

Many cases of police officers tracking people down for personal reasons.

Data can be breached. Identity theft is a thing

The dilema is that the government "should be trusted" with everything becuase they need it to do a lot of tasks like stop terrorism or whatever its pursuing.

desire to be honest can be used against you

personal interest can be used to obtain data

covid app - changed privacy act because of security attention on the media



nobody's been able to keep their data. and if we suppose some magic organization could somehow keep data safe, directors change, IT deparments change, and nobody deletes data.





## Privacy

Its the next thing in security - security and privacy needs to go hand in hand as they are equally important and they should be the same

How much info do you need to build an ID?

interesting: higher up in the primeape the species is, the more differently they act when being watched.



panopticon - designed to be the best jail

prisoners could be watched at all times by a single card and the glass was frosted so the guard could see out but none of the prisoners could see where the guard was looking. The prisoners would always feel watched at all times

sending money experiment



the worst hardest problem

the unbalanced pole dilemma

people want to get info off you - companies, governments, individuals

individuals want to keep their data, and companies and governments want your data. We don't have much of  a tug



faraday cages



Rwandan Genocide

killed a group of people based on their nationality, when the data was collected it was probably a wonderful government and nobody questioned giving away nationality details to them.

It then changed and the same data was used to kill people with a different nationality.



Once you've lost your privacy, you've lost it forever.

Someone could've done blackface 10 years ago and posted it somewhere and now they face consequences because its not seen as very funny anymore.
