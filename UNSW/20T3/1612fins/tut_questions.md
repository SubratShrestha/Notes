**Q2.** A fencing contractor purchases a range of fencing materials from the local hardware store in order to build a number of paling fences for a housing project. The hardware store provides its standard trade finance facility to the fencing contractor.

* (a) Explain the operation of trade credit and why the hardware store would provide this type of facility.
* (b) What are the advantages to the fencing contractor in using trade credit?
* (c) Calculate the opportunity cost of an invoice that specifies the following conditions: 1.25/10, n/30. (LO 9.2)



* (a) Trade credit is a facility offered by many suppliers of goods, that provides the purchaser of goods with a specified period before the account must be paid.
	The hardware store would provide trade credit to fencing contractors in order to attract their business. The fencing contractor is able to obtain the fencing materials, carry out the fencing job for a client and receive payment for that job before payment is due to the supplier. The fencing contractor does not need to provide their own funds to finance the purchase of fencing material needed for the job.

* fencing contractor is able to obtain the materials and carry out the fencing job for a client and receive payment for it before the payment to the hardware store is due. Contractor does not need to provide their own funds to purchase the materials.

**Q3.** ANZ bank offers business overdraft facilities to approved customers. In advertising this product, ANZ uses the phrase, ‘Helps you keep doing business’. With reference to the nature of overdraft finance facilities and their use by business owners, explain the relevance of ANZ’s statement.

An overdraft is an arrangement where the business is allowed to place its account into deficit up to some agreed limit, its used by businesses to manage the timing of cash flows, so its placed in deficit when expenses are paid and back into credit when income is received.

As ANZ says 'helps you keep doing business' in that when funds are missing, the business does not have to stop.



**Q4.** As a lending manager with Mega Bank, you have been asked by a corporate client to explain commercial bill financing. Describe the structure of a bank-accepted bill facility. Include in your answer definitions and explanations of the roles of the parties associated with the bill issue. 

* a bill of exchange (written order binding one party to pay a fixed amount to another on demand or at some fixed point in time) isssued by a company to raise short-term finance is a commercial bill, maturities range up to 180 days.
* discount security so does not pay interest
* parties are: *drawer* is the issuer of the bill. credit enhanced if bank accepts the bill bank would be the *acceptor*, *payee* is part that receives funds when bill is sold, *discounter* is the buyer of the bill (investor), and the *endorser* signs the bill when sold.
* bank may act as both acceptor and discounter, and also provide a rollover facility where it agrees to discount bills for a few years.
* banks often discount bills and then sell them into money markets.



**Q7.** A company issues a bank-accepted bill to fund a short-term business project. The bill is issued for 180 days, with a face value of $1500000 and a yield of 9.87 per cent per annum. What amount will the company raise to fund the project?

**Q3.** In a variable-rate loan contract, how does a commercial bank allow for higher or lower credit risk on the part of the prospective borrowers? 

a lender will analyse factors such as the total debt-to-equity ratio of the firm, projected future cash flows, the financial strength of the borrower, past loan repayment performance, the projected performance of the industry and the economy generally, forecast interest rates, the management of the firm and the life cycle of the firm’s products.

**Q5.** Westpac Banking Corporation is currently writing a loan contract for a medium-sized pharmaceutical company. Within the loan contract Westpac intends to incorporate a number of positive and negative loan covenants. 

* (a) What are loan covenants? 

* (b) Explain why a financial institution would incorporate loan covenants into a loan contract. 

* (c) Discuss the nature of positive and negative covenants and give two examples of each.

(a) A method to protect financial risk exposure, can be specified within loan contract and typically restrict business and financial activities of borrowing firm. Most covenants req. firm to maintain min. level of interest cover - calc. by dividing earnings before interest and taxes by the company's interest payments due.

(b) When granting a loan, the lender will want to protect its fin. risk exposure, the risk that the borrower may default on the loan. If the company breaches a loan conenant, its in default on its loan contract, the lender then has the right within conditions specified in contract to protect its exposure by maybe taking possession of the assets of the company.

(c) Covenants can be positive or negative, positive states certain actions that a company must comply with. ex. maintaining a min. level of working capital. ex2. provision of fin. statements to lender. 

Negative limits or restricts the business activities or fin. structure of the company. ex. a limitation on the amt. of dividend that can be paid to shareholders. ex2. req. that the bank must approve further long-term borrowings by the company.



**Q6.** As the owner of a small architectural firm, you approach the Commonwealth Bank to obtain a term loan so that the firm can buy a new computer-aided drawing machine. The bank offers your company a loan of $28500 over a three-year period at a rate of interest of 8.65 per cent per annum, payable at the end of each month. Calculate the monthly loan instalment.

RAIN equation:  \$ 901.657 per month (ex. 10.1).



**Q7.** The architectural firm owner in Question 6 also approaches the National Australia Bank to obtain a quote on the loan facility. The competitor bank (NAB) also offers the company a fully drawn advance of $28500 over a three-year period at a rate of interest of 8.65 per cent per annum, but payable in advance at the beginning of each month. Calculate the monthly loan instalment. Explain why the instalment payment is different from the instalment in Question 6

modified eqn. from above: \$ 895.204261 per month.

Cash flows occurred at the end of each month, so q6 was ordinary annuity, in q7, the instalments were payable in the beginning of each month so its an annuity due. So there is a (1+i) multiplied to the denominator of prev. qn. to adjust for the instalments to occur at the start of each period (month).



**Q9.** After three years of excellent business growth, a local mattress manufacturer decides to expand and purchase new business premises costing \$1250000. In addition, establishment expenses of 0.50 per cent of the purchase price, plus estimated legal expenses of ​\$15000 are payable. The total cost to purchase the property will be financed by ​\$225000 of the firm’s own funds plus a mortgage loan from ANZ Bank. The bank offers a mortgage loan at 8.15 per cent per annum. The loan will be amortised by monthly instalments over the next 12 years, payable at the end of each month. What is the amount of each monthly instalment?

total costs = 1,250,000 + 6,250 + 15,000 = 1,271,250

A = 1,271,250 - 225,000 = 1,046,250; i = 0.0815/12 = 0.00679167; n = 12 x 12 = 144

R = 11,411.39 per month.

# Chapter 13

Q6. Interest rates play an important role in monetary policy determinations, economic performance and the business cycle, and the cost of funds. Financial market participants must therefore understand the term structure of interest rates. 

(a) Define in detail the term yield and explain how a yield curve is constructed. 

(b) Identify three different types of yield curves. Describe each of these yield curves and draw a fully labelled diagram of each curve. (LO 13.3)



(a) Yield is the total rate of return on an investment over some period of time. Its a percentage based on the invested amount, and the face value of the security. It includes the interest earned or dividends received from holding the asset. The yield curve is a graph that plots the yield on the vertical axis and term to maturity in the horizontal axis. The slope of the yield curve gives an idea of the future interest rate changes. 

(b) A normal curve has a positive slope so the long-term interest is higher than short-term interest rates, an inverse curve has a negative slope so the short-term interest is higher than the long-term interest rates, and the humped yield curve has variable slope, so it goes from being normal to inverse over time.



Q7. Market participants observe that the yield curve is normal (upward sloping). Use expectations theory to explain this observation. (LO13.3)

The expectations theory says that long-term interest rates will be equal to the average of the current short-term rate and the expected future short-term rates. According to the expectation theory, the normal yield curve will result from expectations that the future short-term rates will be higher than current short-term rates. Since the market believes that future short-term rates will be higher than current, long-term rates will not fall, and so the yield curve will be upward sloping.



Q9. The segmented markets theory extends our understanding of factors that influence the determination of interest rates. 

(a) Identify and explain two assumptions of the expectations approach that are challenged by the segmented markets approach to interest rate determination. 

(b) It may be argued that the segmented markets approach is negated by modern risk management practices, arbitrage and speculation. Explain what is meant by this assertion. (LO 13.3)



(a) The two assumptions that are challenged are:

- that all bonds are perfect substitutes for one another
	- bonds that have 1 year to maturity is not a perfect substitute for a bond with 10 years to maturity.
- that investors don't care about holding instruments with short  and long term to maturity.
	- segmented markets theory says that some market participants have a preference for short term to maturity securites and some prefer long term to maturity (different segments of the market)
	- ex. Life insurance companies have long-term liabilities, so they prefer to invest in longer-term to maturity assets. 
	- ex. bank whose deposit base mainly has short-term deposits, the bank can protect itself from liquidity demands (people asking for their money back) prefer to invest in short-term securities that can be sold quickly in the money markets.
	- so the segmented markets theory says that the market participants will want to minimise the risk, rather than seeking to get the max. profit.

# Chapter 4

Q3. (a) Briefly explain the concept of corporate governance within the context of a corporation. 

(b) What is the relationship between corporate governance and the so-called agency problem? (LO 4.1)

(a) Corporate governance in a corporation is the relationship b/w the shareholders, board of directors, and management to ensure accountability and transparency is part of the corporate culture.

Shareholders elect board of directors, board sets the objectives and policies of firm, and appoints executive managers that are responsible for managing day to day business operations and reporting back.



(b) The agency problem comes from the fact that since managers control business operations and don't own the company, they don't have the incentive to benefit shareholders rather than benefit themselves. Corporate governace can be used to change the rules that the manager operates on so that they have incentives encouraging them to act according to the shareholder's interests like implementing share options that allow managers to buy company shares at discounted price so they are encouraged to raise the value of the shares.



Q4. Most developed or developing countries seek to establish modern and efficient stock exchanges. 

(a) Identify and discuss the five principal functions of a modern and efficient stock exchange. 

(b) Why is it important to maintain modern and efficient stock exchanges?



(a) 

* establishment of markets in a range of financial securities 
* provision of a securities trading system 
* operation of a clearing and settlements system 
* regulation and monitoring of the integrity of the exchange’s markets 
* provision of a well-informed market, to secure the confidence of all participants.

(b) 





Q5. Discuss why a strong primary market is important for economic growth within a country and explain how each of the main participants in the primary issue of securities interacts with each other during the share issuance process. 

The primary market role of the stock exchange is to facilitate the issue of new securities by corporations. The primary market issue of net equity is the source of capital funds for the corporations, these funds allow the maintenance andgrowth of a business. Primary market issues facilitate the process of conversion of savings to investment,which theoretically leads to an accumulation of capital capacity, economic growth, increased productionand higher levels of employment. Corporations occupy the central position in the process, receivingfunds from the issuance of securities. Underwriters and advisors guide corporations through theissuance process and funds flow through brokers from individuals, institutions and overseas investorswith surplus funds to invest. The process is facilitated by a stock exchange.
