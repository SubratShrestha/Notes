# Commercial Banks

# Main Activities.

More complex than they take deposits and invest those by making loans to customers. This is a large proportion of their activities, they provide a full range of financial services.

### Balance-sheet transactions

balance-sheet transactions are assets (e.g. loans), liabilities (e.g. deposits) and shareholders’ funds(equity).

### Off-balance-sheet transactions

Off-balance-sheet items are contingent liabilities; that is, they are transactions that do not appear on the balance sheet. 

For example, commercial banks have developed expertise in the provision of risk management products, using a range of over-the counter and exchange-traded derivative instruments. They also provide products and services that assist their customers to carry out import and export business.



They compete aggressively to obtain funds needed to provide loans and services. To provide loans, they forecast future loan demand to ensure they ave the funds available to meet the demand. As they lend millions in short-term, ensuring availability is critical. To do this they've moved from **Asset Management** to **Liability Management.**



### Asset Management

In the highly regulated banking sector, Asset management was the dominant practice. Because of regulations, banks restricted their loan activity (assets) to match the available amount of deposits received. It was uncommon for them to run out of funds for lending by the end of the month. It was expected that customers would come back next month to try again to obtain a loan.



### Liability Management

developed with the removal of restrictive regulation. It is the normal practice today. They now actively manage their sources of funds (liabilities) in order to ensure they have sufficient funds available to meet loan demand and other commitments. If loan demand is forecast to increase (assets are forecast to increase), banks enter the capital markets and borrow the necessary funds required to meet their forecast loan demand. Banks are no longer dependent on their deposit base for lending. They manage their liability base by borrowing directly from the domestic and international capital markets. As the major banks typically have high credit ratings, they are able to borrow substantial amounts, especially within the international capital markets.





# Sources of Funds.

Where does the bank obtain the funds that it lends??

In order to attract the savings of surplus entities, commercial banks offer a range of instruments with different terms to maturity, liquidity, rates of return and cash-flow attributes.

The main sources of commercial bank funds are:

* Current Account Deposits 
* call or Demand Deposits
* term deposits
* negotiable certificates of deposit
* bill acceptance liabilities
* debt liabilities
* foreign currency liabilities
* loan capital and shareholders’ equity



## Current Account Deposits

Liquid funds held in cheque account; cheques drawn to purchase goods and services.

One of the most liquid instruments offered by a bank. Funds helod in cheque account facility. The current account holder able to write order on cheque instructing bank to pay funds to the name payee.

Even though curent account deposits are liquid, they provide a stable source of funds for banks because they can be used to pay for goods and services. Dynamics of an economy means individuals and businesses are continually transacting goods and services so current account deposits are always being maintained, thereby creating an ongoing funding source for the banks.

Business checque account reffered to as operating account, used by a business to pay periodic expenses. A checque account will generally pay low interest. The level of interest reflects highly liquid nature of current account deposits. 

This is like the everyday account at ANZ.



## Call or Demand Deposits

Funds held in savings account that can be withdrawn on demand.

Generally referred to as savings accounts, they usually receive low interest payments. Low interest represents highly liquid nature and low risk.

Banks typically charge transaction and account service fees on them, the low rate of return combined with transaction costs discourage customers from maintaining too much in this account. They've historically represented stable source of funds fro banks. This derives from individual's collective desire to hold some funds in an account that can easily be used to meet forecast expenses and unexpected emergencies.



## Term Deposits

Funds lodged in an account for a predetermined period and at a specified fixed interest rate. They receive fixed interest for the period. Saver nominates term to maturity - 1 month to 5 years.

Higher return than current or call deposits compensates saver for loss of liquidity. Often used as investment alternative for surplus funds that are not required immediately.

Safe and stable investment attractive to conservative investor, popular in countries with ageing population who seek secure investments. History shows times of volatility means savers revert to safe haven of the bank term deposit.



## Negotiable Certificates of Deposit

Discount security issued by a bank, referred to as CD.

Issued by bank undertaking to pay bearer the face value of CD at maturity - up to 180 days. Different from other forms of deposit, in that bank may issue it directly into the money market. CDs dont include any interest, and sold by the bankto an investor at discount to face value.

Ex. face value of 180-day CD is 100,000, buyer must pay 96,755.38. On maturity, holder will receive 100,000 on presentation of CD to bank. Such investment would represent return 3,244.62 = yield of 6.80 per cent per annum.

CDs are Negotiable securities bec. there is a deep and liquid secondary market for CDs, original purchaser can sell it at any time up to maturity.

yield on new CDs can be adjusted quickly as funding requirements change - rate of return can be changed from one transaction to another which is not easily achieved on the more standard bank deposits, they have become imp. in liability management approach of banks.



## Bill Acceptance Liabilities

Short-term money-market discount security whose face value repayable at maturity.

A business may seek to raise funds through **bill of exchange**, and a bank may take 2 roles in the bill - act as acceptor or may discount the bill. If bank takes the acceptance role, then the bill is "bank-accepted bill".

A bill is a discount security, and in order to encourage investors to buy the bill, they may ask bank to accept the bill. The acceptor, on behalf of the issuer, will repay the face value of bill at maturity. By acting as acceptor, bank increases creditworthiness of bill, and bank will have separate arrangement in place to ensure they recover funds at maturity. Ofc, bank charges fee for this service.

Bank may also agree to discount and buy the bill from issuer. Rather than hold the bill to maturity, bank is most likely to sell (re-discount) bill immediately to money market. In this situation, bank incurred a liability on balance sheet because of the acceptance commitment ie. agreement to repay face value at maturity. By sellng bill into money market, bank able to arrange finance for its business customer without having to use its own funds.



## Debt Liabilities

Discussed domestic money-market instrument (CD) above, but majority of bank's assets are longer-term loans, thus banks must acitively borrow in capital markets in order to fund part of their lending.

**Medium to long-term instruments issued by banks are debentures, unsecured notes and transferable certificates of deposit.**

**Debentures** and **unsecured notes** are bonds issued by corporations, including banks that pay a regular interest - fixed or variable coupon to holder, usually semi-annually or annually. Principal repaid at maturity. They are bonds with a form of security attached. The security for bank-issued debenture is usually a collateralised floating charge - if borrower defaults, lender will take possession of borrower's assets. Unsecured note is a bond without securities

Transferable certificates of deposit are long-term fixed-rate instruments typically issued with min. face value of 100,000 with terms to maturity of 3-5 years.



## Foreign Currency Liabilities

Debt instruments issued into international capital markets denominated in another currency.

Deregulation opened up opportunities for banks to expand activities and fund balance sheets from international sources ex. deregulation included floating of exchange rate of major currencies, opening up foreign exchange markets and removal of most restrictions on floa of capital in international markets.

Large capital markets are important source of foreign current liabilities. Banks find it easier to raise substantial amounts of debt in international cap markets, often at a net lower cost than in traditional transaction-based depositor base. 

ex. Major Australian banks ((National Australia Bank, Westpac Banking Corporation, Commonwealth Bank and ANZ Banking Group) periodically issue debt instruments into international cap markets to raise amounts ranging from 500m to 1b which is used over the next 3-6 months to fund demand for loans.

International debt issues are typically denominated in foreign currency. The types of debt issued are the same as those issued in domestic markets and include discount securities, medium-term notes, debentures and unsecured notes.

Globalisation means bank's major corporate clients have become more internationalised, increasing business demand for financial services denominated in the currencies of their transactions. That demand provides a further reason for banks to seek foreign currency liabilities.



## Loan Capital and Shareholder's Equity

Sources of funds that have characteristics of both debt and equity, described as "loan capital" or hybrid securities. Ex. bank may issue subordinated notes, subordinated meaning the holder will only be paid interest payments or have the principal repaid after the entitlements of all other creditors have been paid.

Banks are listed corporations, ie. institution issues equity securities such as ordinary shares that are quoted on a stock exchange. Also banks typically generate profits from their business activities. Some of profit paid to shareholder as dividends, some kept as retained earnings, increasing shareholder's funds. Equity is an imp. source of long-term funds for banks. In fact, banks are req. by the bank regulator to hold minimum levels of equity (capital).





# Uses of Funds

Funds used by banks appear as assets on their balance sheets. The majority of bank assets are assets that create an entitement to future cash flows, ex. bank gives customer a loan, the amount outstanding on loan will appear as assets because bank is entitled to receive periodic interest payments plus repayment of principal. We can categorise commercial bank assets into:

* personal and housing finance
* commercial lending
* lending to government
* other bank assets



## Personal and Housing Finance

Housing Finance is the provision of long-term funds to enable the purchase of a residential property. Its where the bank registers a mortgage - form of security whereby a lender registers an interest over the title of a property. This is an attractive form of lending as the risk of default by borrower is normally low. In theory, borrowers try and meet housing loan commitments bec. if they don't, bank will take possession of house and sell it to recover owing amount.

Commercial banks have traditionally dominated residential housing loan market but new providers of housing finance have entered, increasing competition.
