# Chapter 13: Connect Questions

Q1. Consider the situation in which the Reserve Bank has increased interest rates through its market operations in order to reduce the level of spending in the economy. As the rate of growth in economic activity slows, the demand for funds also slows. This impact of a change in interest rates is described as the:



Multiple Choice

- inflation effect.

- liquidity effect.

- income effect.

	Correct

- monetary effect.

## Explanation



The buying or selling of government securities by the central bank will change the level of liquidity in the financial system and this can cause interest rates to change. In turn, an initial change in rates can affect the level of spending in the economy and have flow-on effects related to the associated changes in income and demand for funds. This secondary effect is known as the income effect.



Q2. A country's central bank will adjust interest rates if major economic variables are out of line with levels or values that are considered appropriate. Which of the following is *not* a factor that is likely to result in an upward adjustment of interest rates?



Multiple Choice

- The balance of payments is too deeply in deficit.

- The domestic currency is under upward pressure in the FX markets.

	Correct

- The rate of growth in the economy is excessive.

- Credit is growing too rapidly.

## Explanation



The factors listed in three of the answers could lead a central bank to increase interest rates. However, to relieve upward pressure on the domestic currency, it would be necessary to *reduce* interest rates.



Q3. A tightening of monetary policy can be expected to have several effects. Which of the following is *not* one of the expected effects?



Multiple Choice

- The rate at which suppliers of goods and services increase their prices should moderate.

- Demand for imports should decrease.

- The flow of investment funds into the country should fall.

	Correct

- Spending will slow in interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy.

## Explanation



Tightening monetary policy means increased interest rates and higher rates should have the effects of slowing spending in interest rate-sensitive sectors, moderating the rate at which suppliers of goods and services increase their prices and increasing (not reducing) the flow of investment funds into a country, while demand for imports should fall.



Q4. Financial market economists and central banks constantly analyse movements in several economic indicators. Which of the following is *not* a recognised key economic indicator?



Multiple Choice

- Non-residential building approvals

- Retail sales

- Second-hand motor vehicle sales

	Correct

- Job vacancies

## Explanation



Many variables are used as economic indicators including capacity utilisation, job vacancies, building approvals, retail sales and registrations of new motor vehicles. However, sales of second-hand vehicles are not usually regarded as economic indicators.



Q5. The supply of loanable funds consists of three main sources. Which of the following is *not* one of those three sources?



Multiple Choice

- Changes in the money supply

- The savings of the household sector

- Retained earnings and other savings of the business sector

	Correct

- Dishoarding

## Explanation



While savings of the household sector are a source of loanable funds, retained earnings are subtracted from the investment needs of the business sector to arrive at a net demand for funds by that sector.



Q6. One approach to explaining and forecasting interest rates focuses on the supply of and demand for loanable funds. Which of the following statements about the demand for loanable funds is *not* correct?



Multiple Choice

- The borrowings of the government sector are normally assumed to be independent of the rate of interest

- The rate of interest and the volume of funds demanded are positively related.

	Correct

- The business sector and the government sector are both assumed to have a net demand for funds.

- The relationship between the rate of interest and the volume of funds demanded is represented by a downward sloping demand curve.

## Explanation



Higher interest rates will decrease the volume of funds demanded by borrowers.



Q7. The total demand for loanable funds illustrated in Figure 13.6 includes a section that is vertical. Which of the following provides the best explanation for this phenomenon?



Multiple Choice

- Household sector supply of loanable funds is related to the level of interest rates.

- Business sector demand for loanable funds is positively related to interest rates.

- Business sector demand for loanable funds is negatively related to interest rates.

- Government sector demand for loanable funds is not significantly influenced by interest rate levels.

	Correct

## Explanation



The vertical section of the demand curve arises from the government's demand for funds. In drawing the curve, it has been assumed that the government is committed to a certain level of expenditures that must proceed regardless of the level of interest rates.



Q8. The loanable funds approach can be used to analyse the impact on interest rates from changes in the economy. For example, an increase in the level of economic activity should result in higher interest rates. Which of the following is *not* one of the financial market ‘events’ leading to that result?



Multiple Choice

- As the supply of securities increases, the prices of those securities will fall and their yields increase.

- Businesses invest in additional real assets.

- Businesses borrow and sell securities to obtain funds for investing in additional real assets.

- Some savers will revise their portfolios by selling securities.

	Correct

## Explanation



An increase in economic activity is very likely to be associated with businesses investing in additional real assets, businesses borrowing and selling securities to obtain funds for investing in additional real assets and, as the supply of securities increases, the prices of those securities will fall and their yields increase. However, the higher yields on securities will cause savers to *buy* securities.



Q9. Market participants monitor economic indicators to gain insights into future monetary policy initiatives and future economic activity. Which of the following is correct?



Multiple Choice

- The number of indicators used by market participants is small.

- An indicator that behaves as a leading indicator during one period will usually remain as a leading indicator for many years.

- It is usually easy to establish the lead or lag period for each indicator.

- An economic indicator may be classified as a leading, coincident or lagging indicator.

	Correct

## Explanation



Each economic indicator may be classified as a leading, lagging or coincident indicator of overall economic activity.



Q10. The loanable funds approach predicts that an increase in inflationary expectations will result in a change in interest rates. Which of the following statements about the likely extent and direction of the change is most accurate?



Multiple Choice

- Interest rates will initially increase and then fall to less than the original level.

- Changes in the supply of and demand for funds are likely to result in an increase in rates that is smaller than predicted by the Fisher effect.

	Correct

- Interest rates will increase by exactly the amount of the increase in expected inflation.

- Changes in the supply of, and demand for, funds are likely to result in an increase in rates that is larger than predicted by the Fisher effect.

## Explanation



An increase in inflationary expectations may result in an increase in interest rates that is less than predicted by the Fisher effect. One reason for this is that higher inflation will increase the government's tax revenue and decrease its borrowing requirement. Also, higher inflation is likely to increase the supply of funds by encouraging dishoarding and greater saving.



Q11. The following yields on Commonwealth Government securities were observed on the same date:

 

| **Term to maturity** | **Yield (% per annum)** |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Three months         | 5.65                    |
| Six months           | 5.80                    |
| One year             | 5.95                    |
| Two years            | 6.15                    |
| Three years          | 6.25                    |
| five years           | 6.18                    |
| 10 years             | 6.07                    |

 

What type of yield curve is indicated by the above data set?



Multiple Choice

- Inverse yield curve

- Variable yield curve

- Usual yield curve

- Humped yield curve

	Correct

## Explanation



Since short-term interest rates initially increase with longer term-to-maturity, and longer-term rates then decline, the yield curve is humped.



Q12. Using the pure expectations approach to the determination of interest rates, calculate the expected interest rate on a one-year investment that will be available in 12 months' time (*E*1*i*1), given the following data:

Current rate of return on a one-year-to-maturity (0*i*1) instrument is 6.75 per cent per annum.

Current rate of return on a two-year-to-maturity (0*i*2) instrument is 7.25 per cent per annum.



Multiple Choice

- 7.25 per cent

- 7.75 per cent

	Correct

- 8.25 per cent

- 6.75 per cent

## Explanation



The expected rate in one year's time may be calculated using Equation (13.1) which is 0i2 = (0*i*1 + *E*1*i*1)/2. In this case: 7.25 = (6.75 + *E*1*i*1)/2 which solves to give *E*1*i*1 = 7.75%.



Q13. Several theories have been advanced to explain the shape of the yield curve. Which of the following is *not* one of those theories?



Multiple Choice

- Expectations theory

- Liquidity premium theory

- Market segmentation theory

- Loanable funds theory

	Correct

## Explanation



The loanable funds theory is a theory of how the general level of interest rates is determined, not a theory of the term structure of interest rates.



Q14. The segmented markets theory is an alternative to the expectations theory. Which of the following is the most accurate summary of the basis for the segmented markets theory?



Multiple Choice

- As investors, banks have a preference for short-term securities.

- Investors' preferences for different segments of the market are based on risk management rather than profit maximisation.

	Correct

- Life offices and superannuation funds prefer to invest in long-term securities.

- Securities in different maturity ranges are perfect substitutes for one another.

## Explanation



The segmented markets theory of the term structure is based on the view that some market participants have a preference to invest in securities with certain terms to maturity. Further, it maintains that these preferences are based on the desire to manage risk and will be adhered to even if profits could be increased by investing in other segments of the market.



Q15. Yield curves may be used to illustrate the term structure of interest rates. A yield curve may be most accurately described as:



Multiple Choice

- the relationship between yield and term-to-maturity for all debt securities in the market at a given time.

- the relationship between yield and term-to-maturity for securities that are uniform in terms of default risk.

	Correct

- the relationship between yield and term-to-maturity for government securities.

- a graph showing total returns on a sample of related securities.

## Explanation



The yield curve is used to illustrate the term structure of interest rates. As such, it is a plot of the yields on securities that have different terms to maturity. In order to focus on the relationship between yield and term, the securities should have the same default risk. This is usually achieved by plotting the yield curve for government securities that are assumed to have no risk of default.



Q16. The expectations theory of the yield curve is based on several assumptions. Which of the following correctly states one of those assumptions?



Multiple Choice

- There are frictions that prevent market rates moving to their equilibrium levels.

- Financial investors hold largely heterogenous expectations about the future values of short-term rates.

- Bonds are imperfect substitutes for each other regardless of maturity.

- There are no transaction costs, so investors can easily buy and sell instruments.

	Correct

## Explanation



The assumptions underpinning expectations theory include investors with homogenous expectations, frictionless markets that have no impediment in attaining equilibrium rates, bonds that are perfect substitutes regardless of term to maturity, and the absence of transaction costs.



Q17. Which of the following is the most accurate summary of the main implication of the segmented markets approach?



Multiple Choice

- Investors will seek to match the cash flows and maturities of their assets and liabilities.

- Market participants prefer to hold securities that will help to minimise the riskiness of their portfolios.

- All bonds are perfect substitutes for one another.

- Yields are determined by the relative supply of, and demand for, securities in various maturity ranges.

	Correct

	

Q18. The yield curve is flat and the central bank makes a substantial increase in the supply of short-term government securities. According to the segmented markets approach, the result should be:



Multiple Choice

- an inverse yield curve.

	Correct

- a usual yield curve.

- a humped yield curve.

- a variable yield curve.

## Explanation



According to the segmented markets approach, a substantial increase in the supply of short-term securities should depress the prices of such securities and increase their yields. In accordance, a flat yield curve would become downward sloping or inverse.



Q19. The central bank purchases short-term bonds and sells an identical quantity of long-term bonds so that the average maturity of bonds in the hands of the public increases. According to the expectations theory:



Multiple Choice

- long-term interest rates will rise.

- the yield curve will not be affected.

	Correct

- short-term interest rates will fall.

- the slope of the yield curve will increase.

## Explanation



The expectations theory holds that the yield curve is determined by investors' expectations of future interest rates, and it is not affected by changes in the supply of securities with different terms-to-maturity.



Q20. The central bank sells short-term bonds and buys an identical quantity of long-term bonds, so that the average maturity of bonds in the hands of the public decreases. According to the segmented markets theory:



Multiple Choice

- the yield curve will not be affected.

- the slope of the yield curve will increase.

- short-term interest rates will fall and long-term interest rates will rise.

- short-term interest rates will rise and long-term interest rates will fall.

	Correct

## Explanation



According to the segmented markets theory, the increased supply of short-term bonds should lower the prices of short-term bonds and increase their yields. Conversely, the prices of long-term bonds should increase and their yields should fall.



Q21. Which of the following most accurately outlines the key differences between the assumptions that underlie the expectations and liquidity premium theories?



Multiple Choice

- The liquidity premium theory does not assume that transaction costs are zero.

- The liquidity premium theory does not assume that short- and long-term bonds are equally attractive to investors.

	Correct

- The liquidity premium theory recognises that investors' expectations about future interest rates are not homogeneous.

- The expectations theory assumes that investors aim to maximise returns while the liquidity premium theory assumes a goal of risk reduction.

## Explanation



The pure expectations theory assumes that all bonds are equally attractive to investors. In contrast, the liquidity premium theory recognises that long-term bonds are more risky than short-term bonds.



Q22. The liquidity premium theory recognises an important difference between short-term and long-term securities. Which of the following is *not* correct in relation to the liquidity premium theory?



Multiple Choice

- The effect of the liquidity premium is that long-term interest rates will be lower than the pure expectations theory suggests.

	Correct

- Longer-term bonds have greater price risk than short-term bonds.

- Shorter-term securities have greater liquidity than longer-term securities.

- Investors are willing to accept lower yields on short-term investments.

## Explanation



Longer-term bonds have greater price risk than short-term bonds, shorter-term securities have greater liquidity than longer-term securities and investors are willing to accept lower yields on short-term investments, all of which are consistent with the liquidity premium theory. The correct answer is the reverse of what the theory proposes.



Q23. Observations of the shape of the yield curve over time can provide evidence supporting the validity of the various theories of the term structure of interest rates. Which of the following statements about these theories is most accurate?



Multiple Choice

- The yield curve is usually close to flat, which supports the expectations theory.

- The expectations theory cannot explain why the yield curve is sometimes inverse.

- Observations of the shape of the yield curve over time support the expectations theory.

- The liquidity premium theory is supported by the fact that the yield curve is upward sloping most of the time.

	Correct

## Explanation



If the yield curve is determined purely by expectations of future interest rates, upward and downward sloping yield curves should be observed with approximately equal frequencies. However, the yield curve is upward sloping most of the time and this observation is consistent with longer-term rates being increased by the inclusion of a liquidity premium.



Q24. Evidence from studies of the yield curve suggests that the greatest understanding of the behaviour of the yield curve is provided by the:



Multiple Choice

- liquidity premium theory.

- segmented markets approach.

- expectations theory.

- expectations theory modified by the presence of a liquidity premium.

	Correct

## Explanation



Studies of the yield curve provide little, if any, support for the segmented markets approach. Many studies provide support for the roles of expectations and liquidity preferences, but they do not indicate that either of these factors alone can explain the behaviour of the yield curve. Rather, the evidence is consistent with expectations theory modified by the presence of a liquidity premium.



Q25. An investor is given the following data:

Current rate of return on a one-year-to-maturity (0*i*1) instrument is 5.95 per cent per annum.

Current rate of return on a two-year-to-maturity (0*i*2) instrument is 6.68 per cent per annum.

What is the implicit forward rate for the second year, when the long-term rate is calculated as the geometric mean of a series of one-year rates?



Multiple Choice

- 7.41 per cent

- 7.415 per cent

	Correct

- 6.80 per cent

- 7.818 per cent

## Explanation



The implicit forward rate for the second year may be calculated using Equation 13.4: *E*1*i*1 = (1 + 0*i*2)2/(1 + 0*i*1) – 1. In this case; *E*1*i*1 = (1.0668)2/(1.0595) – 1 = 0.07415 or 7.415 per cent.



Q26. Which of the following is *not* a valid statement about corporate borrowings relative to borrowing by government?



Multiple Choice

- In contrast to government borrowings, all corporate borrowing involves some element of default risk.

- The risk premium for a borrower is positively related to lenders' assessments of its default risk.

- Lenders will demand a risk premium for lending to corporate borrowers.

- The risk premium for a given borrower is unlikely to vary over time.

	Correct

## Explanation



The risk premium for each corporate borrower usually does vary over time.



Q27. It is argued that a major weakness of the loanable funds approach is that a final equilibrium interest rate cannot be determined following a disturbance that affects the supply of, or demand for, funds. Which of the following statements best explains why this weakness exists?



Multiple Choice

- Changes in the supply of funds are likely to cause changes in the demand for funds and vice versa.

	Correct

- The rate of increase in the money supply varies over time.

- Any equilibrium identified using the loanable funds approach is only temporary.

- Dishoarding of loanable funds will continue for successive periods.

## Explanation



Supply and demand analysis can be used to determine the effect of, say, an increase in supply, if the demand curve is known. However, in the market for loanable funds, such analysis is complicated by the fact that changes in the supply of, and demand for, funds are not independent. For example, an increase in the money supply will increase the supply of funds and tend to reduce interest rates. Lower interest rates should stimulate businesses to invest more, increasing the demand for funds. With supply and demand both changing, a final equilibrium cannot be determined as it is likely to cause changes in the demand for funds and vice versa.



Q28. The yields on debt securities vary due to two main factors: differences in term to maturity and differences in risk. The risk structure of interest rates is essentially concerned with:



Multiple Choice

- the effects of default risk.

	Correct

- the effects of changes in interest rates on the prices of securities.

- the effects of default risk and changes in interest rates.

- variations in the default risk of a borrower over time.

## Explanation



Various risks can be identified that are relevant to debt securities. For example, there is the risk that interest rates may change, causing the prices of debt securities to change. While interest rate risk and price risk are important, the phrase ‘risk structure of interest rates' is used to refer to the effects of default risk.



Q29. Which of the following is most accurate? The task of forecasting interest rates is:



Multiple Choice

- difficult because interest rates change independently of most other economic variables.

- simple because future interest rates are determined largely by the growth rate in the economy.

- simple because future interest rates are determined largely by the inflation rate.

- difficult because releases of new data on the state of the economy often give conflicting indications.

	Correct

## Explanation



Interest rates are notoriously difficult to forecast. The links between overall economic activity and interest rates may be well understood. However, new data on variables such as consumer prices, exports, imports and building activity often give differing indications of the state of the economy.



Q30. The yield curve can take on several different shapes but a limited number of typical shapes are identified. A usual yield curve is one where:



Multiple Choice

- medium-term rates are higher than both short-term and long-term rates.

- short-term rates and long-term rates are approximately equal.

- short-term rates are higher than long-term rates.

- short-term rates are lower than long-term rates.

	Correct

## Explanation



The usual yield curve is upward sloping which means that yields increase with increasing term-to-maturity, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates.



Q31. Economic indicators are often divided into categories. Which of the following indicator categories are most useful for anticipating changes in the business cycle?



Multiple Choice

- Lagging indicators

- Current indicators

- Coincident indicators

- Leading indicators

	Correct

## Explanation



Economic data in leading indicators change before changes in the trend in the level of economic activity occur. These indicators are therefore most useful in anticipating changes in the business cycle.



Q32. Identify which of the following is controlled by the Reserve Bank to target desired economic performance outcomes.



Multiple Choice

- The exchange rate

- The gross domestic product (GDP)

- The employment rate

- The official interest rate

	Correct

## Explanation



The monetary policy mandate of the Reserve Bank is to set interest rates in a way that contributes to stability of the currency (price stability), full employment and economic prosperity. That is the Reserve Bank controls the official interest as a mechanism to impact the other three factors listed.



Q33. An interest rate represents the cost of borrowing, so changes in the interest rate impose enormous effects on the economy. Determine which of the following best describes the outcome of an increase in the interest rate.



Multiple Choice

- An increase in the inflation rate and a deterioration of the balance of payments

- A decline in the inflation rate and a deterioration of the balance of payments

- A decline in the inflation rate and an improvement in the balance of payments

	Correct

- An increase in the inflation rate and an improvement in the balance of payments

## Explanation



In the macroeconomic context of interest rates, if there is an increase in interest rates as a result of central bank actions, then it is aimed at tightening of monetary policy in order to slow down the economic growth, especially spending in interest-sensitive areas.



Q34. Which of the following is *not* typically a method used by the central bank to implement its monetary policy?



Multiple Choice

- Interest rate swaps

	Correct

- Repurchase agreements

- Foreign currency swaps

- Buying and selling government securities

## Explanation



According to the text, the three main open market operations are direct buying and selling of government securities, repurchase agreements and foreign currency swaps. Interest rate swaps are used by companies and banks.



Q35. The central bank can adjust the official interest rate through open-market operations. Identify which of the following statements best defines the income effect of the interest rate.



Multiple Choice

- If the interest rate rises, incomes will rise. This will allow the interest rate to rise further.

- If the interest rate rises, incomes will rise. This will allow the interest rate to ease.

- If the interest rate rises, economic activities will begin to slow down. Interest rate falls once the pressure on prices reduces

- None of the answers provided.

	Correct

## Explanation



Income effect on interest rates means if interest rates rise due to the central bank increasing rates by selling government securities, then this could reduce funds and liquidity in the system and lead to lower levels of spending by households, businesses and the government sector. Lower levels of spending then result in lower incomes, not higher.



Q36. The central bank often needs to look at a range of indicators to assess the current state of the economy. Can housing loan approval data be used for that purpose?



Multiple Choice

- Yes, it can be considered a coincident indicator.

- Yes, it can be considered a leading indicator.

	Correct

- Yes, it can be considered a lagging indicator.

- No, this information is irrelevant.

## Explanation



Housing loan approval data can be useful in anticipating changes in the business cycle.



Q37. Determine which of the following correctly refers to the sources of loanable funds.

I. Household savings

II. Changes in money supply

III. Government budget surplus

IV. Dishoarding



Multiple Choice

- I and II

- I, II and IV

	Correct

- I, II and III

- I, II, III and IV

## Explanation



Sources of funds for the loanable funds framework are savings, changes in money supply and dishoarding, but not budget surpluses that result from excess government income versus government expenditure.



Q38. Identify which of the following statements best defines dishoarding.



Multiple Choice

- Interest rate increases as the money supply falls.

- Household savings increase as the interest rate increases.

- Normal cash holding increases as interest rates falls.

- Investment in financial instruments increases as the interest rate increases.

	Correct

## Explanation



Dishoarding refers to the situation where cash holdings fluctuate according to how much is invested in financial instruments, so if interest rates increase there is the incentive to obtain the higher rates.



Q39. Identify which of the following statements best describes the major problem of the loanable funds approach.



Multiple Choice

- The supply curve cannot be determined.

- The supply and demand curves are independent.

- The demand curve cannot be determined.

- None of the answers provided.

	Correct

## Explanation



The problem is that the curves are not independent. A change in the supply curve is likely to influence the demand curve



Q40. Calculate the expected one-year interest rate in two years from now given that the current yields being offered are: 7 per cent per annum, 8 per cent per annum and 9 per cent per annum for one-year, two-year and three-year government bonds respectively.



Multiple Choice

- 11.02 per cent

	Correct

- 10 per cent

- 9.3 per cent

- 12.07 per cent

## Explanation



Using Equation 13.5 and E2 i1, use 0i3 as 9 per cent, with 0i2 as 8 per cent, so = [(1.09)3/(1.08)2]1/1 – 1 = 0.1102



Q41. Determine which of the following best describes forecasts of future interest rates if the central bank wishes to increase the average maturity of the public holdings of government bonds.



Multiple Choice

- The expectation theory approach predicts that short-term interest rates will increase while long-term rates will fall.

- The segmented markets theory predicts that short-term interest rates will increase while long-term rates will fall.

- The expectation theory approach predicts that short-term interest rates will decrease while long-term rates will increase.

	Correct

- The segmented markets theory predicts that short-term interest rates will decrease while long-term rates will increase.

## Explanation



To increase the average maturity the central bank will sell long-term bonds to the public and buy short-term bonds. So accordingly with a greater supply of long-term bonds it will drive down the prices of long-term and accordingly the long-term rates will increase.



Q42. The rate of dishoarding/hoarding is a function of:



Multiple Choice

- the supply of loanable funds.

- the demand for loans.

- interest rates.

	Correct

- the demand for loanable funds.

## Explanation



Hoarding and dishoarding occur by the incentive or disincentive created by interest rates respectively. When interest rates go up, people have the incentive to place cash in deposits and vice-versa.



Q43. When considering the liquidity premium theory, the greatest difficulty is:



Multiple Choice

- determining the liquidity premium.

	Correct

- determining the underlying segmentation curve.

- none of the answers provided.

- determining the underlying expectations curve.

## Explanation



It is generally assumed that the liquidity premium theory adds a premium to an underlying expectations curve. Since the premium should grow with the term, it becomes difficult to determine the actual size of the premium.



Q44. When considering the liquidity, income and inflation effects of interest rate changes, it is difficult to:



Multiple Choice

- determine the time and extent of the effects, but easy to replace indicators.

- none of the answers provided.

- determine the time and extent of the effects, but difficult to replace indicators.

	Correct

- replace lagging indicators.

## Explanation



With the freeing up of markets, it is now difficult to replace leading indicators. As well as this it is impossible to assess the extent of each effect.



Q45. When considering the risk structure of interest rates, the premium above the risk-free rate is primarily:



Multiple Choice

- none of the answers provided.

- liquidity risk

- a combination of risks

- default risk

	Correct

## Explanation



Research has found it difficult to ascertain the exact nature of the risk premium above the risk-free rate. However, the general agreement is that it is dominated by default risk.



Q46. A central bank will most likely consider a reduction in interest rates if:



Multiple Choice

- the rate of growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is excessive.

- the current account of the balance of payments is significantly in deficit.

- the currency is under excessive downward pressure.

- the rate of inflation over the business cycle is below its target range.

	Correct

## Explanation



The central bank will most likely reduce (or at least consider a reduction) in the official interest rate if the rate of inflation over the business cycle is below its target range, rate of GDP growth is low, the current account is in surplus or the currency is excessively strong.
