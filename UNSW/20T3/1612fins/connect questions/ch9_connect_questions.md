# Chapter 9: Connect Questions

Q1. Diego Electrical Services purchases electrical cable, switches and fittings on credit. The company receives an invoice from the supplier that states ‘2/10, n/30'. What does this note on the invoice mean?

- The date is 2 October and the company has 30 days to pay in full.

- If payment is made in 10 days a 2 per cent discount applies; otherwise, full payment is due in 30 days. ✅

- This is the second time in 10 months that the company has been 30 days late.

- If payment is made in two days a 10 per cent discount applies; otherwise, full payment is due in 30 days.

## Explanation

The note means that if Diego pays the account within 10 days there is a 2 per cent discount; otherwise, the full amount shown on the invoice is payable within 30 days.



Q2. MS Plumbing Contractors has received an invoice for goods purchased on credit. The invoice states ‘2/10, n/60'. If MS pays the account within 10 days and receives the discount, what is the opportunity cost of doing so?

- 17.3 per cent
- 14.9 per cent ✅
- 22.36 per cent
- 12.41 per cent

## Explanation

If MS pays early and receives the discount, it earns a return of 2 per cent over 50 days. The corresponding opportunity cost is:

(2/98) × (365/50) = 0.14897 or 14.9 per cent.



Q3. Black Limited is negotiating an overdraft facility with its bank. The bank loan officer has sent the company a letter of offer that includes the terms and conditions shown below. Which of these terms and conditions would usually apply to an overdraft facility?

I. Interest is payable on the daily outstanding debit balance that is monthly in arrears

II. The overdraft is repayable on demand

III. Bank approval is required to draw cheques using the overdraft facility

IV. An establishment fee will be charged

- I, II, IV ✅
- I, III, IV
- II, III, IV
- All of the answers provided

## Explanation

One of the major attractions of an overdraft facility is that it provides the flexibility to draw on the account without obtaining bank approval, provided that the agreed overdraft limit is not exceeded. All the conditions, other than III, usually apply.



Q4. Mills Enterprises Limited is seeking to raise funds by issuing a bill of exchange. The company has been advised to have the bill accepted by a bank. Why should the company obtain bank acceptance for the bill?

- The acceptor will provide the funding by purchasing the bill.
- Bank acceptance improves the bill's credit status and lowers the yield. ✅
- The acceptor undertakes to repay the holder of the bill at maturity if the drawer defaults.
- Banks do not charge a fee to accept bills for established customers.

## Explanation

A bill of exchange must have an acceptor and the yield on the bill depends on the credit status of the acceptor. Since the credit ratings of banks are generally very high, bank bills trade at lower yields in comparison to non-bank bills.



Q5. A provider of trade credit incurs an opportunity cost. Which of the following changes does not increase that opportunity cost?

- Offering a larger discount for early payment
- Reducing the length of the discount period ✅
- Extending the discount period
- Extending the total credit period

## Explanation

The opportunity cost of providing trade credit may be calculated using Equation 9.1. If the length of the discount period is reduced while all other terms remain the same, then the number of days' difference between early and late settlement will increase. Equation 9.1 shows that this change will reduce the opportunity cost.



Q6. Finance through a bill facility has advantages over other forms of short-term debt, including flexibility for the borrower. Which of the following is *not* an advantage of bill finance?

- The cost of bill finance is generally lower than the cost of an overdraft.
- Bill finance has a known cost that is fixed for the life of a bill.
- Bills can be used to borrow small amounts such as $50 000. ✅
- A bill facility can provide longer-term funding by rolling over the bills as they mature.

## Explanation

The minimum face value of a bill is $100 000.



Q7. Bills are discount securities that provide a single cash flow that is equal to the face value at maturity. A company issues a $500 000, 90-day bill with a yield of 7.36 per cent per annum. What amount would the company raise?

- $490 966.22
- $491 028.77
- $490 926.03
- $491 087.77 ✅

## Explanation

The amount raised is the present value of the future cash flow of $500 000 and using Equation 9.2 the present value is equal to $500 000 × 365/(365 + [0.0736 × 90]) = $491 087.77.



Q8. Financial Enterprises Limited issued a 90-day bill with a face value of $500 000. The bill was discounted at 7.68 per cent per annum, giving an issue price of $490 707.48. After 30 days, the discounter sold the bill for $493 630.14. What is the yield to the original discounter?

- 7.68 per cent
- 7.25 per cent ✅
- 7.85 per cent
- 7.52 per cent

## Explanation

The yield may be calculated using Equation 9.5 and is equal to [(493 630.14 – 490 707.48)/490 707.48] × (36 500/30) = 7.25 per cent.



Q9. Which of the following is *not* correct?

- The drawer of a bank-accepted bill has no obligation to pay the holder of the bill at maturity. ✅
- The acceptor of a bill has the primary liability to pay the holder at maturity.
- Banks generate income by accepting bills.
- At maturity, the drawer of a bill has a secondary liability after the acceptor.

## Explanation

The primary responsibility for paying the face value of a bill at maturity rests with the acceptor of the bill. If, for some reason, the acceptor fails to pay, then the drawer is liable to make the payment.



Q10. Bill pricing calculations may be carried out using the yield on the bill or the bill's discount rate. Which of the following statements is correct?

- If calculated correctly, the yield and the discount rate will be the same.
- The discount rate for a bill will always be greater than its yield.
- The discount rate may be greater or less than the yield, depending on the bill's term to maturity.
- The discount rate for a bill will always be less than its yield. ✅

## Explanation

The yield and discount rate applicable to a bill will not be the same. The yield is a measure of the rate of return on a bill as a percentage of the bill's market value. The discount rate is expressed as a percentage of the bill's face value. Since the market value of a bill is always less than its face value, the yield will be numerically larger than the discount rate.



Q11. Commercial bills may be classified as bank bills or non-bank bills. Which of the following is correct?

- The classification depends on whether the drawer of the bill is a bank or a non-bank.
- The classification depends only on whether the acceptor of the bill is a bank or a non-bank.
- A bill that is accepted or endorsed by a bank is a bank bill. ✅
- A bill accepted by a building society or an investment bank is a bank bill.

## Explanation

Three statements contain errors. A bill that is either accepted by or endorsed by a commercial bank is regarded as a bank bill.



Q12. Transnational Corporation is to offer the next tranche of a 90-day promissory note issue to investors at a yield of 6.95 per cent per annum. Each note has a face value of $100 000. What is the price of each promissory note to the investors?

- $98 835.17
- $98 315.17 ✅
- $100 000
- $101 713.70

## Explanation

Using Equation 9.2 the present value of each note is equal to $100 000 × 365/(365 + 0.0695 × 90) = $98 315.17.



Q13. Which of the following is correct?

- A commercial bill usually has a face value of at least $1 000 000.
- A borrower that wishes to establish a bank-accepted bill facility must have a rating provided by an external credit rating agency.
- Bills normally have a term to maturity of at least 180 days.
- Banks provide rollover facilities that allow the term of a bill financing arrangement to exceed the term of an individual bill. ✅

## Explanation

Three statements contain errors. Banks do provide facilities where they agree to accept or discount additional bills once existing bills reach maturity.



Q14. Promissory notes and bills of exchange have many similarities, but they also have some important differences. Which of the following statements is *not* correct?

- Both bills and notes are discount securities.
- There is an active secondary market in both bills and notes.
- Both bills and notes require an acceptor. ✅
- Promissory notes are commonly known as ‘one name paper’.

## Explanation

Both bills and notes are discount securities with active secondary markets. While bills require an acceptor, this is not the case with notes. The issuer of a note is solely responsible for paying the face value at maturity, which explains why notes are often referred to as ‘one name paper’.



Q15. The yield on a bill will depend on the credit rating of the parties that incur a liability under a bill. Which of the following statements is correct?

- Bank-accepted bills trade at a lower yield than non-bank bills. ✅
- The yield on a bill will depend mainly on the credit rating of the drawer.
- Bank-accepted bills trade at a higher yield than non-bank bills.
- The yield on a bill is unrelated to the credit standing of the acceptor.

## Explanation

The acceptor of a bill is primarily responsible for payment of its face value at maturity—so the risk of, and yield on, a bill depends on the credit rating of the acceptor. Since banks generally have higher credit ratings than other acceptors, bank bills trade at lower yields than non-bank bills.



Q16. When a customer requests an overdraft facility, the credit analysis performed by the bank will include:

- the type and amount of collateral available in case of default.
- the length of time between the firm’s cash inflows and outflows.
- forecasting of future financial performance
- all of the answers provided. ✅

## Explanation

In establishing an overdraft facility, a bank will analyse the credit risk of the customer. This will include forecasting future performance to assess ability to service debt, the length of the typical mismatch between cashflows, and the adequacy of the collateral available in event of default.



Q17. Mega Bank issues negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs) with a maturity of 180 days and a face value of $1 million. The notes are purchased by institutional investors at 20 basis points above BBSW. At the time, BBSW was 6.95 per cent per annum. What is the price of the CDs?

- $1 000 000
- $965 940.67 ✅
- $966 861.81
- $1 035 260.27

## Explanation

With the margin of 20 basis points, the yield on the CDs will be 7.15 per cent per annum. Certificates of deposits are a discount security, so the price can be found using Equation 9.2 and is equal to ($1 000 000 × 365)/(365 + 0.0715 × 180) = $965 940.67.



Q18. Which of the following statements about promissory notes is *not* correct?

- The majority of issuers have an investment grade credit rating.
- An issue often involves both a tender panel and an underwriting syndicate.
- P-notes are usually issued on a large scale.
- The costs associated with a P-note issue are usually very low. ✅

## Explanation

A promissory note issue involves several parties: a manager, members of a tender panel and an underwriting panel. Therefore, the issue costs are significant rather than ‘very low'.



Q19. Inventory finance commonly adopts a system known as bailment. Which of the following statements relating to bailment is correct?

- Bailment is a system that is often used in providing floor plan finance for motor vehicles.
- Assets are purchased from a distributor by a finance company (bailor).
- A bailor grants possession of assets to a bailee for display purposes.
- All of the answers provided. ✅

## Explanation

In general, inventory finance involves a bank or finance company (bailor) providing a loan to finance the inventory of a dealer (bailee) in goods, such as motor vehicles, where the inventory is used as security for the loan. Floor plan finance is a form of inventory finance that uses a system known as bailment. In this case the financier owns the inventory and allows a retailer to have possession of the goods to display them for sale.



Q20. Which of the following is *not* correct?

- A bill of exchange is a negotiable instrument supported by a legal structure.
- Bills of exchange may be categorised as trade bills and commercial bills.
- Bills of exchange may be categorised as bank-accepted, bank-endorsed or non-bank.
- A bank-endorsed bill carries the name of the endorsing bank from the time the bill is issued. ✅

## Explanation

A bill is endorsed by the seller when it is sold, not when the bill is issued.



Q21. Accounts receivable financing is the extension of a loan to a business against the security of its receivables. Which of the following statements relating to accounts receivable financing is *not* correct?

- The main suppliers of accounts receivable financing are finance companies.
- Generally, only some of the receivables on a company's books will be acceptable as security.
- The lender will takeover the management of the borrower's receivables. ✅
- The borrower remains liable for any bad debts.

## Explanation

Accounts receivable financing is short-term finance, where accounts receivables serve as security for the loan. The lender only provides finance and the borrower continues to issue invoices and manage its receivables in the usual way.



Q22. Which of the following statements in relation to factoring is *not* correct?

- In the case of a with-recourse facility, the factor has no claim against the vendor business. ✅
- The factor is responsible for the collection of accounts receivables.
- Most factoring arrangements are established on a notification basis.
- Factoring allows the vendor business to substitute cash for receivables.

## Explanation

Factoring involves a business obtaining cash by selling its accounts receivables. The factoring company is responsible for collection of the receivables but if the factoring is with-recourse, the factor *can* claim against the selling firm in the event that some of the receivables cannot be collected.



Q23. Which of the following statements about commercial bills is *not* correct?

- The face value of a commercial bill is payable at a specified future date.
- A commercial bill pays no interest.
- A commercial bill is a discount security.
- Commercial bills are an important source of long-term finance for large and medium-sized firms. ✅

## Explanation

Bills provide short-term finance. 



Q24. A company needs to raise $1 million to fund an increase in purchases. The funds will be raised by issuing a 180-day bill at a yield of 7.5 per cent per annum. What should be the face value of the bill?

- $1 000 000
- $1 036 986.30 ✅
- $964 332.89
- $963 013.70

## Explanation

The face value must be greater than \$1 million and can be found using Equation 9.4. The calculation is face value = \$1 000 000 × [(365 + 0.075 × 180)/365] = $1 036 986.30.



Q25. A 90-day bill with a face value of $500 000 is issued at a yield of 9.85 per cent per annum. Fifteen days later the bill is sold by the original discounter at a discount rate of 9.75 per cent per annum. At what price does the original discounter sell the bill?

- $488 144.12
- $500 000
- $489 982.88 ✅
- $489 167.93

## Explanation

When the bill is sold it has 75 days to maturity. The price can be found using Equation 9.6. The calculation is price = \$500 000 × [1 – (75 × 0.0975/365)] = $489 982.88.



Q26. Which of the following statements relating to overdrafts is *not* correct?

- The interest rate on an overdraft is usually equal to a published indicator rate plus a margin.
- Each country usually has its own indicator rates.
- The interest charged on an overdraft is usually calculated by applying the agreed interest rate to the balance at the end of each month. ✅
- An overdraft facility does not have a regular repayment schedule.

## Explanation

The interest on an overdraft is calculated daily, not monthly.



Q27. A 180-day bill with a face value of \$500 000 was issued with a yield to maturity of 11.25 per cent per annum. Thirty days later, the market price of the bill is $478 000. What is the current discount rate applicable to the bill?

- 8.8 per cent
- 11.25 per cent
- 10.71 per cent ✅
- 10.25 per cent

## Explanation

When the face value and current price of a bill are known, the discount rate can be found using Equation 9.7. In this case the discount rate is equal to [(500 000 – 478 000)/500 000] × [36 500/150] = 10.71 per cent.



Q28. Which of the following statements about promissory notes is correct?

- The minimum face value of a promissory note is $1 million.
- Promissory notes are issued directly by the borrower and the only role of financial institutions is to purchase the notes.
- Any borrower who could issue bank bills has the alternative of issuing promissory notes.
- The face value of a promissory note is usually at least $100 000. ✅

## Explanation

The face value of a promissory note is usually $100 000 or more. Financial institutions are involved in arranging and underwriting promissory note issues. P-notes will be accepted in the market only if the issuer has a high credit rating. There are many small and lower rated borrowers who can borrow through bank bills, but they could not issue P-notes.



Q29. An underwritten issue of promissory notes will involve several parties including a lead manager, an underwriting syndicate and a tender panel. Which of the following statements about the roles of these parties is correct?

- The lead manager arranges the note issue and purchases any notes that are not taken up by the tender panel.
- Members of the tender panel have the first opportunity to buy the notes. ✅
- The lead manger's role is essentially to ensure that all necessary documentation is correctly prepared.
- Members of the underwriting syndicate will be chosen for their willingness to buy and hold a large proportion of the issue.

## Explanation

It is the underwriters, not the lead manager, who purchase any notes that are not taken up by the tender panel—who have the first opportunity to buy the notes. The lead manager's role goes well beyond attending to documentation. Members of the underwriting syndicate will be active in marketing the notes to investors and will, generally, not be willing to hold a large proportion of the issue.



Q30. Large, highly rated firms have access to funding from a wide range of sources. However, small- to medium-size firms do not have access to the same sources. Which of the following sets of sources are usually available to smaller firms?

I Bank overdraft

II Commercial paper

III Investment bank cash advance

IV Inventory finance

- I, II
- I, III
- II, IV
- I, IV ✅

## Explanation

Commercial paper (promissory notes) can be issued only by large borrowers with very high credit ratings. Only large firms usually use investment bank cash advance facilities. Smaller firms may have access to bank overdrafts, trade credits, factoring and inventory finance.



Q31. Large firms have access to funding from a wide range of sources. Which of the following sets of sources are usually available to large non-financial (that is, industrial and mining) firms with credit ratings below investment grade?

I Bank overdraft

II Commercial paper

III Negotiable certificates of deposit

IV Inventory finance

- I, II
- I, IV ✅
- I, III
- V, IV

## Explanation

A large firm can issue commercial paper only if it has a high credit rating, so those with a rating that is below investment grade would not be able to do so. Only banks issue negotiable certificates of deposit.



Q32. Which of the following statements is correct regarding bills of exchange?

- Trade bills are used to raise non-specific business finance.
- Commercial bills are used to finance specific trade transactions.
- Bank-accepted bills are a form of commercial bill. ✅
- Non-bank bills are a form of trade bill.

## Explanation

Trade bills are used to finance specific trade transactions, while commercial bills are used for non-specific business finance. Both bank-accepted bills and non-bank bills are forms of commercial bill and not trade bills.



Q33. Whirlwind Inc. policy allows its customers to receive a trade credit of 2/10, n/30 term for making early payments. Calculate the rate of return forgone if its customers decide to pay for goods purchased on credit later than 10 days.

- 24.83%
- 37.24% ✅
- 24.33%
- 36.5%

## Explanation

Use Equation 9.1 to find cost foregone with price discounted 2 per cent and days different between early and late settlement of 30 – 10 = 20.



Q34. Identify which of the following statements in relation to the order of liability for payment of a bill is *not* correct.

- It runs from the drawer to the acceptor, then to the endorsers in ascending order from the last endorser.
- It runs from the acceptor to the drawer, then to the endorsers in descending order from the first endorser.
- It runs from the drawer to the acceptor, then to the endorsers in descending order from the first endorser.
- It runs from the acceptor to the drawer, then to the endorsers in ascending order from the last endorser. ✅

## Explanation

When a financial institution does bill acceptance, it takes the primary liability to repay holder at maturity, then drawer is next and then in ascending order from the last endorser.



Q35. ABC Corp. has established a one-year bank-accepted-bill rollover facility with Bank A&B which starts with the issue of a 30-day bill having a face value of $200 000 and yielding 8.5 per cent per annum. Calculate the money it has to pay the bank on the date that the existing bill matures if it is determined that the bank will discount the new bill at 8.9 per cent per annum.

- $1387
- $1452 ✅
- $65
- $800

## Explanation

ABC has to pay the difference between the face value of the old bill and the discount price of the new bill. So Equation 9.2 with face value 200 000 and yield of 8.9 and 30 days is used to find the discount price of the new bill giving $198 547.61.



Q36. A company decides to fund short-term inventory needs by issuing a 60-day bill with a face value of \$200 000. It is expected that investors generally demand a yield of 14 per cent per annum to purchase non-bank bills issued by companies with a similar credit rating. The bill being accepted by SA Bank for an acceptance fee of ​\$10 000 can be sold to investors at $197 000. SA Bank is willing to discount the bill at 10 per cent per annum. Determine which of the following is the best option for the company.

- Issuing the bill as a non-bank bill.
- Issuing the bill being accepted by SA Bank.
- Having the bill discounted by the bank. ✅
- Cannot be determined based on the given information.

## Explanation

The amount raised by first non-bank option using Equation 9.2 needs to be worked out. So working out how much the company will raise by non-bank bill using 14 per cent gives \$195 500 and then compare to the amount of $197 000 using the SA bank gives the SA bank with the smaller discount and so a lower cost of borrowing.



Q37. Ninety days ago, Adriana bought a 180-day bill with a face value of $200 000 yielding 9.25 per cent per annum. Calculate the price she can get for selling it today if current 90-day bills are yielding 8.5 per cent per annum in the market.

- $195 540
- $195 894 ✅
- $195 637
- $191 274

## Explanation

Use Equation 9.2 to work out the price with yield as 8.55 and days to maturity as 90 days.



Q38. Ninety days ago, Elena bought in a 180-day bank-accepted bill yielding 9 per cent per annum. Calculate the return that he will earn if the bill is sold today, given that 90-day bills are currently yielding 7 per cent per annum in the market.

- 10.81% ✅
- 9%
- 7%
- 8%

## Explanation

Use Equation 9.2 to find price of the bill if sold today and then use Equation 9.5 to find the holding period yield with days held rather than days to maturity.



Q39. P-notes and commercial bills are different forms of short-term finance. Identify which of the following statements in relation to those instruments is *incorrect*.

- The advantage of P-notes over bills is that sellers are not required to endorse the notes when they are sold in the market.
- The face value of a P-note is normally a minimum of $100 000.
- A disadvantage of P-notes is that only corporations with an excellent credit reputation are able to issue P-notes.
- A difference between P-notes and commercial bills is that P-notes generally have a term to maturity of at least 180 days. ✅

## Explanation

P-notes are a short-term security with term to maturity up to 180 days, not longer.



Q40. P-notes can be issued by companies with a good credit rating. Identify which of the following statements in relation to P-note issues is *not* correct.

- An external manager is always required in a P-note issue. ✅
- If the lead manager has arranged a tender panel in a P-note issue, members of the tender panel are given the first opportunity to buy P-notes.
- P-note issue may not be successful if the credit rating of the issue is below the investment grade.
- The underwriting fee is typically about 0.1% on the amount of their commitment.

## Explanation

If the company has an excellent credit reputation and a track record of issuing P-notes, then it may not require an external manager with extra cost involved.



Q41. What are the relevant aspects that factor companies need to consider in assessing whether to provide the account-receivable finance to a firm?

I. Its efficiency and profitability

II. The prospect of its future sales

III. Its customers being regular, longstanding buyers

- I and III
- I and II
- II and III ✅
- All of the answers provided

## Explanation

In providing account-receivable finance the factor company is interested in the details for the customers of the firm—how well they pay their bills and the track record of the customers.



Q42. Calculate the yield of a 60-day bill with the face value of $200 000, which is currently selling at $195 000, given that it will mature in 30 days.

- 15.20%
- 15.60%
- 30.41% ✅
- 31.19%

## Explanation

Use Equation 9.5 with face value 200 000, selling price of 195 000 and days to maturity of 30 days.



Q43. The reason that banks charge unused limit fees is:

- to make more money.
- to recognise that funds are available at call. ✅
- to ensure that the account fully fluctuates.
- none of the answers provided.

## Explanation

Banks are required to have access to liquidity in the event that corporations draw down their overdrafts. Therefore, companies not using their overdraft incur a cost to the lender. To recognise this, banks charge for the non-use of overdrafts.



Q44. If the acceptor on a bank bill defaults, then:

- the drawer repays. ✅
- the first endorser repays.
- the last endorser repays.
- none of the answers provided.

## Explanation

A bank bill has a definite chain of repayment responsibilities. Investors would first go to the acceptor but in the event the acceptor defaults, next in line would be the drawer and then endorsers first to last.



Q45. The difference between a promissory note and certificate of deposit is:

- one is a discount security and the other is not.
- one is accepted and the other is not.
- one is long term and the other is not.
