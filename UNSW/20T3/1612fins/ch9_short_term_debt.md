# Chapter 9: Short term debt (Debt  Markets 1)

Short term => Maturity < 1y

Lot of different types of short term debt because borrowers have different needs in terms of timing of repayment, risk, interest rate structures (variable or fixed) and the source of funds.



## Matching Principle

Short-term assets should be funded with sort-term liabilities and vice versa.

# Securities

## Negotiable Certificate of Deposit

Short-term discount security **issued by banks** to manage their liabilities and liquidity. Issued by banks => banks (deficit unit) wants to borrow money. (There is also low credit risk because its the bank that's borrowing the money and they are less likely to default)

Issued at discount to face value (FV > P). Bank (deficit) issues it, buyer (surplus unit) buys at Price and at maturity, Bank pays back the face value, and buyer makes profit = FV - Price.

Maturities range up to 180 days.

Issued to institutional investors in the wholesale money market. Money market because short term, wholesale because sold at a large amount, and that kind of money is usually with institutional investors.

Security => tradable, the short-term money market has an active secondary market in CDs.



## Bills (Commercial or Bank accepted bills)

Short-term discount security **issued by corporations** to raise funds for general business purposes.

Bank accepted bill is a bill that is issued by the corp. and incorporates the name of a bank as the acceptor to increase creditworthiness and ofc, bank receives generous fees for accepting the bill. This means that at maturity, the buyer will turn to the acceptor to receive the face value.

security => tradable.



### Parties Involved (Bank acceptor bill).

* Drawer
	* Issuer of the bill - Borrowing company
	* secondary liability for repayment of the bill (after the acceptor)
		* when the borrower defaults, if the bill was accepted by a bank, the bank will be the first party the buyer will turn to (first liability) and then if the bank defaults as well (highly unlikely), buyer will turn to the borrowing corporation (second liability)
* Acceptor
	* usually a bank (someone with high credibility)
	* receives fees for its sevice.
* Payee
	* Party to whom the bill is to be paid (the borrowing company)
	* Usually same as the drawer, but the drawer can specify some other party as payee
	* ex. Bill draw by starbucks US, and the payee is starbucks AU (US company issues the bill but they say the money is to be paid to the australian branch)
* Discounter
	* The buyer of the bill (surplus unit), they 'discount' the bill => they buy at price and get face value (>) at maturity.
	* provider or lender of the funds.
	* may also be the acceptor of the bill (think its when the bank wants to buy the bill for a corp. and acts as the acceptor and the discounter)
* Endorser
	* this is the party that was the previous holder of the bill (security => tradable), so this is the previous owner of the bill
* Order of liability: Acceptor -> drawer -> endorser



### Advantages of Commercial bills

why would any corp get a commercial bill or bank accepted bill rather than just borrow from the bank?

* Lower cost than other short-term borrowing forms like overdrafts and fully drawn advances (borrowing directly from banks).
* Borrowing cost not affected by changes in interest rate. The borrowing company receives the money from buyer and at maturity, pays the face value + acceptor fee. Nothing can change within that time span, there is no volatility, its just fixed amount borrowed and fixed amount paid back. Changes in interest rate, inflation etc. have no impact on borrowing cost.
* The bill may be extended by a 'rollover', meaning they can borrow for longer if they choose.
* Banks can be the acceptor and discounter, so this is borrowing from the bank who will have the funds, and are very creditworthy, and have all the advantages of having lower borrowing cost and not being affected by any market 





## Promissory Notes

Also called commercial paper or P-notes are short term discount securities issued in money markets.

Different to bills as they have **no acceptor** or **endorser**, and so they are unsecured instruments. Because of this **only corporations with excellent credit reputations can issue them**.

Like IPOs, they can have underwriters that help the corporation get the amount they need.

* Underwritten issues
	* underwriting guarantees the full issue of notes is purchased and typical fee of 0.1% per annum.
	* underwriter is usually a commercial bank, investment bank or merchant bank
	* underwritten issue can incorporate rollover facility, effectively extending the borrower's line of credit beyond the short-term life of the P-notes.
* non-underwritten issues
	* issuer may approach the money market directly.
	* commercial bank, investment bank or merchant bank may be retained as lead manager and receive fees.



# Calculations

* Price, Face value:

	* $$\begin{align*}
		P = \frac{FV}{(1\ +\ r)^t},\ P=price, F=face\ value, r=yield, t=days\ to\ maturity\ /\ 365
		\end{align*}$$
	* $$FV = P(1+rt)$$

	

* Yield:

	* $$
		Yield = \frac{sell - buy}{buy}\times\frac{36500}{days\ held\ or\ maturity}
		$$

	

* Discount rate:

	* $$
		Discount\ rate = \frac{sell-buy}{FV}\times\frac{36500}{days\ held\ or\ maturity}
		$$

		

	* ex. Company decides to fund short-term inventory needs by issuing 30 day bank accepted bill /w fv = 500,000. Having approached 2 potential buyers, company was quoted yields of 9.52% and 9.48% per annum. Which should company take and what amount will the company raise?

	* The company should take the lower yield, because the company doesn't want to give more yield to the buyer because if the yield goes up, the price goes down and the company doesn't end up raising as much but will have to pay the same FV in the end.

	* $$
		P\ =\ \frac{500,000}{(1 + 0.0948 * \frac{30}{365})} = \$496,134.
		$$

		

	* ex. Company needs to raise 500,000, they decide to raise through 60 day bank accepted bill rollover facility. Bank agreed to discount bill at yield 8.75%. At what FV will initial bill be drawn?

	* needs to raise => price = 500,000, r = 0.0875, t = 60/365 for discount securities, fv = ?

	* $$
		FV = P(1 + rt) = 500000(1 + 0.0875 * \frac{60}{365}) = \$507,191.75
		$$

	

	* ex. Company issued 30 day bank accepted bill with fv of 500000, bill was discounted at yield 9.48% per annum, representing price of 496134.23. After 7 days, discounter sells bill in money market for 497057.36. Bill is not traded again in the market. Calc. yield to original discounter and to the holder at maturity.

	* for holder to maturity:

		* $$
			r = \frac{500000 - 497057.36}{497057.36}\times\frac{36500}{23} = 9.39\%
			$$

		* 

	* for original discounter that sold after 7 days:

		* $$
			r = \frac{497057.36 - 496134.23}{496134.23}\times\frac{36500}{7} = 9.70\%
			$$

# Non-Securities

Short term debt that is NOT tradable.



## Bank Overdrafts

Major source of short-term finance.

Allows a firm to place its cheque (operating) account into deficit to an agreed limit. (basically a credit card). 

They are generally operated on fully fluctuating basis, and the lender also imposes an establishment fee which is a monthly account service fee and a fee on the unused overdraft limit.

Interest rates negotiated with bank at a margin above an indicator rate, reflecting the borrower's credit risk (higher interest for more risky clients)

indicator rate is typically a floating rate based on a published market rate like BBSW.





## Trade credits

Supplier provides goods and services to a purchaser with an arrangement for payment at a later date.

Often includes a discount for early payment (ex. 2/10, n/30 => 2% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise full amount due in 30 days).

For providers of this debt, it increases sales but there are discount costs, increased discount period, increased total credit period and accounts receivable, increased collection and bad debt costs.
$$
Opportunity\ cost = \frac{discount}{100\ -\ discount}\times\frac{365}{late - early\ (days)}
$$

* ex. opportunity cost of purchaser forgoing discount on invoice (1/7, n/30)
	$$
	Opportunity\ Cost\ =\ \frac{1}{100-1}\times\frac{365}{30-7}=0.160208=16.03\%
	$$
	

When should we pay early?

* when you can obtain funds at an after-tax rate of less than the opportunity cost.
* when your surplus cash that has alternative use of lower return than opportunity cost.



## Inventory finance

Most common form is 'floor plan finance'.

Particularly designed for the needs to motor vehicle dealers to finance their inventory of vehicles.

The car dealer does not own the cars he keeps, its the finance company that holds title to the stock and the dealer is expected to promote the financer's products



## Accounts receivable financing

Loan to business secured against its accounts receivable.

Supplied by finance companies.

Lending company takes the borrowing company's accounts receivable, but the borrowing company is still responsible for the accounts receivable to be converted to cash.



## Factoring

Company sells its accounts receivable to a factoring company. Factoring provides immediate cash to the borrowing company and it removes admin costs of accounts receivable.

Main providers of factor finance is again, finance companies.

The factors (lenders) are responsible for collection of those accounts receivable (unlike accounts receivable financing, the lending company is responsible for converting the accounts receivable of the borrowing company into cash, but there are recourse arrangements and non-recourse arrangements).

* Recourse arrangements -> the factor (lending company) has a claim against the vendor (borrowing company) if a receivable is not paid
* Non-recourse -> the factor has no claim against vendor.
