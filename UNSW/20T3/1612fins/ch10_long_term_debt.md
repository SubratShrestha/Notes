# Chapter 10: Long term debt

Financing arrangement for a period of more than 1y with different borrower needs like timing of repayment, risk, interest rate structures (variable or fixed), and source of funds.

Specifically for long term debt, the borrower should consider:

* fixed or variable interest rate
* Term of the financing arrangement
* Repayment schedule
* Loan covenants
* Whether secured by fixed or floating charge, or unsecured 
* Leasing an asset vs buying the asset 

# Securities

## Debentures and Unsecured notes

Securities => tradable.

They are corporate **bonds** issued in the corporate bond market, they specify that the lender will receive regular interest payments (called coupons) during the term of the bond and receive repayment of the FV at maturity.

**Debentures** are **secured** bonds, they are secured by either a fixed or floating charge over the issuer's unpledged assets. They are listed and traded on the stock exchange, and they also have a higher claim over a company's assets (ex. on liquidation of the firm) than **unsecured** note holders.  

Three ways they can be issued:





## Subordinated debt

# Non-Securities

## Term loans and Fully drawn advances

Loan advanced for specific period (3-15 yrs) for a known purpose like buying land, premises, plant and equipment.

Secured by mortgage over asset purchased or other assets of the firm.

**Fully drawn advance** is a term loan where the full amount is provided at the start of the loan period.

Usually term loans are provided by commercial banks and finance companies, and to a lesser degree, investment banks, merchant banks, insurance offices and credit unions.



### Structure of term loans

**Usual structure**: Interest only during term of loan and principal repayment on maturity.

**Amortised or credit foncier loan**:

* Periodic loan instalments consisting of interest due and reduction of principal.



**Deferred repayment loan:**

* Loan instalments commence after specified period related to project cash flows and the debt is amortised over remaining term of loan.



**The interest rate** charged on term loans are based on:

* an indicator rate (ex. BBSW or bank's own prime lending rate)
* credit risk of borrower
* term of loan
* repayment schedule

Other fees can include: establishment fee, service fee, commitment fee, line fee.



### Loan Covenants

They are extra terms and conditions on the borrower and they restrict the business and financial activities of the borrowing firm. This is done so that the borrowers **remain** creditworthy. Since we're talking about loans of 3 - 15 years, the borrower can become less creditworthy in that time, so lenders set up loan covenants to make sure the borrowers are still creditworthy.

In that 3 - 15 years, the borrower could have taken more loans from other lenders and this reduces their creditworthiness, or they could have made horrible investment choices, etc.

* Positive loan covenants (something lender has to do): requires the borrower to take prescribed actions like provision of financial reporting to the lender.
* Negative loan covenants (things lender cannot do): restricts the activities of borrower ex. borrower must maintain max. Debt to Equity ratio, or borrower must maintain min. working capital ratio.

Breach of these loan covenants result in default on the loan, and this entitles the lender to the borrower's assets, or whatever was discussed in the loan contract.



Ex. The CFO of a corporation has arranged term loan for company with conditions: loan will have variable interest of BBSW plus 95 basis points. The loan interest will be reset every 6 months for duration of the loan.

The interest is not fixed, and is reset every 6 months, so the lender is checking up on the borrower every 6 months and can decide on a new interest rate, that interest rate will depend on the market rate (BBSW) and the creditworthiness of the borrower, that 95 can go up or down depending on the financial condition of the borrowing company. 





## Mortgage Finance

form of security for a loan. The borrower (mortgagor) says he wants to buy the land and property to the lender (mortgagee).

If the mortgagor defaults, the mortgagee is entitled to foreclose on the property i.e take possession of assets and realise any amount owing to the loan.

Mainly used to finance retain home loans up to 30 year terms and to a lesser degree, commercial property loans up to 10 years as businesses generate cash flows enabling the repayment.

The providers are commercial banks, building societies, finance companies, and mortgage originators.
