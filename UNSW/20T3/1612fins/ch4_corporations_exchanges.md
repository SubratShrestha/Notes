# Corporations

## Advantages of being publically listed

* obtain large amount of finance for cheap
* separation of ownership and control
* perpetual succession - long-term survival of corporation and unaffected by changes in ownership and management
* large  scale
* **Evidence**:
	* Following GFC, many corporations were forced to raise additional capital through the stock market (if companies weren't corporations, they wouldn't be able to do this)
	* this was to 'sure up' their balance sheets during the tough economic environmnet that followed the crisis because the regulators were saying companies need Quality Capital which is equity, and corporations had access to the stock exchange and could obtain that quality capital, the other option was to get debt which is borrowing and the regulators would not be happy with companies borrowing more.
	* smaller firms are not able to access capital as easily and would normally be expected to pay a higher rate of return.



## Disadvantages

* Agency Problem:
	* conflict of interest between the management (agents) and the shareholders, managers don't own the company so they have little incentive to maximize profit for the shareholders.
	* Factors that mitigate Agency Problem:
		* investors can sell shares causing share price to drop which is an indication of poor mangement.
		* dismissal from Board by shareholders.
		* Threat of takeover when the share price drops and the loss of employment that comes with that.
		* use of performance incentives like share options.
		* more rigorous corporate governance.
