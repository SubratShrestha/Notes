# Corporations

## Advantages of being publically listed

* obtain large amount of finance for cheap
* separation of ownership and control
* perpetual succession - long-term survival of corporation and unaffected by changes in ownership and management
* large  scale
* **Evidence**:
	* Following GFC, many corporations were forced to raise additional capital through the stock market (if companies weren't corporations, they wouldn't be able to do this)
	* this was to 'sure up' their balance sheets during the tough economic environmnet that followed the crisis because the regulators were saying companies need Quality Capital which is equity, and corporations had access to the stock exchange and could obtain that quality capital, the other option was to get debt which is borrowing and the regulators would not be happy with companies borrowing more.
	* smaller firms are not able to access capital as easily and would normally be expected to pay a higher rate of return.



## Disadvantages

* Agency Problem:
	* conflict of interest between the management (agents) and the shareholders, managers don't own the company so they have little incentive to maximize profit for the shareholders.
	* Factors that mitigate Agency Problem:
		* investors can sell shares causing share price to drop which is an indication of poor mangement.
		* dismissal from Board by shareholders.
		* Threat of takeover when the share price drops and the loss of employment that comes with that.
		* use of performance incentives like share options.
		* more rigorous corporate governance.

# Exchanges

Stock exchange, securities exchange or bourse is facility where stock brokers and traders can buy and sell securities like shares of stocks and bonds and other financial instruments.

The main functions of exchanges are to:

* Raise capital
* Trading

# Roles of stock exchange

## Primary role of Stock exchange

A stock exchange facilitates the efficient and orderly sale/issue of **new** financial securities through:

* **Initial Public Offerings (IPO)** is the initial listing of a corporation on the stock exchange
* **Rights issue** is the issue of additional shares to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis
* **Placements** is the issue of new shares to selected institutional investors
* **Dividend reinvestment plans** is the reinvestment of dividends into corporations for additional shares. 



## Secondary role of Stock exchange

* Facilitates trading in existing shares.
* No new funds are raised by the issuing company
* An active, liquid, well-organised secondary market increases the appeal of buying new shares in primary market (helps with subsequent raising bec. company has to get ongoing funding).
* **calculation question that can show up**
	* Market liquidity = ratio of value of share turnover (trading volume or trading value) to market capitalisation (no. of shares on issue x current share price)
	* market capitalization gives us a view of the size of the corporation or the exchange itself.



## Managed product role

* provides a market for trading managed products (unit trusts)
* equity-based managed products are professionally managed funds
* the units are bought and sold on the stock exchange in the same way as shares in corporations
* ex. ETFs, real estate investment trusts (REITs), infrastructure funds



## Derivative market role

* provides a market for trading equity-related derivative products
* a derivative is a financial security that **derives** its price from an underlying commodity (like gold) or financial instrument (like shares of BHP or options)
* They can be:
	* Exchange traded contracts that are **standardised** financial contracts traded on formal exchange like options, warrants, futures contracts, contracts for difference.
	* over-the-counter contracts are non-standardised contracts negotiated between writer and buyer.



## Interest rate market role

market that facilitates issue of debt securities and the subsequent trading of those securities on a formal exchange like Straight corporate bonds, floating rate notes (FRNs), convertible notes, preference shares.

These were over-the-counter contracts (non standardised and not traded in exchanges) but are now listed on exchanges because they add value like:

* transparency because the information about price, yield, maturity and credit rating of debt instruments.
* ease of entry - electronic trading system facilitates buy and sell orders at minimum cost and time delay at current market prices.
* liquidity - quotation on a stock exchange provides access to a wider market.



## Trading and settlement role

Exchanges facilitate the buyer and seller, buyer gives money to exchange, exchange passes it on to seller, seller gives ownership to exchange, and exchange gives ownership to buyer, when all this happens, the trade is settled.

Trades in the ASX are settled in T +2 days with the Clearing House Electronic Sub-register System (CHESS). It provides an electronic sub-register that records the ownership of listed securities.

A CHESS sponsor is a market participant with access to CHESS like a stockbroker.



## Information role

The confidence in the exchange relies on informational efficiency. The current share prices should reflect all information available in the market, determined by:

* speed at which new info. flows to the market
* speed at which that info. is absorbed and reflected in the share prices.

Information:

* change in company's financial forecasts
* appointment of liquidator
* declaration of a dividend
* notice of a takeover bid
* disclosure of director's interests



## Regulatory role

Aim of regulation is to ensure market participants have confidence in the integrity of market operations.

The exchange (ASX)

* ensures listed companies meet specified limited levels of performance standards of info. disclosure so investors can make informed decisions.
* Prescribes appropriate behaviour of brokers and implement sanctions that include dicipline, penalties, and loss of licence.
* Electronic surveillance systems monitor trading behaviour and
	* detect trades that fall outside certain limits
	* cross-references all trades against information on the relevant company, directors, and associated parties.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) which oversees the exchanges:

* supervision of Corporations Law and markets in Australia (Corporations Act 2001)
* market integrity and consumer protection across the financial system, covering investment, insurance and super products
* supervises the ASX, addresing potential conflicts of interest as a publicly listed corporation.
