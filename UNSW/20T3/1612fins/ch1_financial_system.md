## The Financial System.

* Financial system:

	* Range of financial institutions, instruments and markets.
	* overseen by the central bank.
	* supervised by prudential regulator.

* Financial instruments:

	* issued by a party raising funds, acknowledging a financial commitment and entitling the holder to specified future cash flows
	* like a receipt that says you will get some return in the future.

* Assets:

	There are other factors that savers should consider, other than the rate of return. Providers of funds (savers/surplus) should consider their own needs when they purchase assets. Assets, whether real (investment property) or financial (bank term deposit) has 4 attributes:

	* return or yield
		* total financial benefit received (interest and capital gain) from an investment (percentage).
	* risk
		* possibility or probability that an actual outcome will vary from expected. 
		* based on the risk, there are different types of savers:
			* risk averse (little risk) (individuals and businesses), risk neutral (neutral), risk takers (high risk).
	* liquidity
		* access to cash and other sources of funds to meet daily expenses and commitments.
	* time-pattern of cash flows
		* frequency of periodic cash flows (interest and principal)

* Asset Portfolio:
	* a combination of assets, each comprising attributes of return, risk, liquidity and timing of cash flows
	* a major function of the financial system is to facilitate portfolio structuring and restructuring through the buying and selling of a wide range of financial instruments. Financial institutions and markets provide the potential suppliers of funds with the combinations of risk, return, liquidity and cash-flow patterns that best suit each saverâ€™s particular portfolio needs.

* Monetary policy:
	* relates to the actions of a central bank that are taken to influence the level of interest rates in the financial system. The current monetary policy stance of central banks in developed countries is to maintain the level of inflation within a specified level.
	* actions taken by a central bank to maintain some level of inflation.
		* they can do this by increasing or decreasing the cash-rate which is like the interest rate, but on commercial banks from the central bank. So the central bank will charge some interest on the money they provide to commercial banks, this is the cash rate. **Cash rate and inflation have an inverse relationship**, when cash rates go down, so do the interest rates of commercial banks, so then us consumers can now borrow more, and hence our purchasing power is increased, so in consequence, since the consumer's purchasing power has increased, producers can, and will charge more for the same products, and so the price of goods and services have gone up (positive inflation).
		* also makes sense that when cash rates go down, commercial banks borrow more from the central bank, and we can borrow more from commercial banks, and so there will be more of the currency in circulation, and so the value of it goes down (depreciation different to deflation).

* Functions of a financial system:
	* to facilitate portfolio structuring and restructuring through the buying and selling of a wide range of finanacial instruments. A financial system provide the potential savers with assets of different combinations of risk, return liquidity, and cash-flow patterns that best suit the saver's needs.
	* to provide finanacial and economic information to market paraticipants. Information affects price and investment decisions, therefore the provision of timely and accurate information is essential for an efficient financial system.
	* can be argued that an efficient financial system should ensure that savings are more likely to be directed to the most efficient users of those funds. This further enhances the reate of economic growth. This is because savers will seek to maximize their return, subject to their preferred attributes of the assets, so they should be expected to invest their funds with users that show a high probability of meeting those expectations (investing in corporations that use funds to produce goods and sevices that are in demand in the marketplace).
	* to implement monetary policy.



* Types of Financial Institutions
	* Depository financial institutions
		* obtain their funds from savers. 
		* principal business is the provision of loans to borrowers in the household and business sectors.
		* ex. deposits placed in demain deposit accounts or term deposit accounts with commercial banks, building societies and credit cooperatives.
	* invesment banks
		* focus on provision of advice for corporate and government clients on mergers, acquisitions, portfolio restructuring and financial risk management.
		* may provide loans to clients bt morelikely to advise and assist them to raise funds directyly from capital markets.
	* contractual savings institutions
		* insurance offices, general insurers and superannation funds.
		* their liabilities are mainly contracts which specify that in return for periodic payments to the institution, they will make specified payouts to the holder if and when an event occurs.
		* the periodic cash receipts received provide them with large pool of funds that they invest.
		* Payouts made by these institutions include payments for claims made on an insurance policy, or payment to a superannuation fund member on their retirement from the workforce.
	* finance companies and general financiers
		*  raise funds by issuing financial instruments such as commercial paper, medium-term notes and bonds in the money markets and the capital markets.
		* they use those funds to make loans and provide lease finance to their customers in the household sector and the business sector
	* unit trusts
