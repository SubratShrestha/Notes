## Exchange rates

Exchange rate is value of one currency relative to that of another currency. Each country or monetary union responsible for determining own exchange rate regime.

Major currencies like USD, GBP, JPY, EUR, and AUD adopt floating exchange rate (free float) regime, i.e determined by supply/demand.

Other types include:

* Managed float: held within defined band relative to other currency ie Singapore, Indonesia, China.
* Crawling peg: allowed to appreciate in controlled steps over time ie. China (arguable)
* Linked exchange rate: tied to value of another currency or basket of currencies ie HKD

Writing exchange rates:
$$
AUD/USD=0.7185\ or\\
\\
\frac{AUD}{USD}=0.7185\ or\\
\\
1\ AUD\ =\ 0.7185\times USD
$$
