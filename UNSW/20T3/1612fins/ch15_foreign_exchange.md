# Foreign Exchange Markets (FX)

## Exchange rates

Exchange rate is value of one currency relative to that of another currency. Each country or monetary union responsible for determining own exchange rate regime.

Major currencies like USD, GBP, JPY, EUR, and AUD adopt floating exchange rate (free float) regime, i.e determined by supply/demand.

When the USD is the base currency, its called **direct** quote and when its some other country as base, its an **indirect** quote.

Other types include:

* Managed float: held within defined band relative to other currency ie Singapore, Indonesia, China.
* Crawling peg: allowed to appreciate in controlled steps over time ie. China (arguable)
* Linked exchange rate: tied to value of another currency or basket of currencies ie HKD

Writing exchange rates:
$$
\frac{base}{terms}=rate\\
AUD/USD=0.7185\ or\\
\\
\frac{AUD}{USD}=0.7185\ or\\
\\
1\ AUD\ =\ 0.7185\times USD
$$



## Supply/Demand of currency

When measuring the price of the currency (in terms of another currency) on the Y axis and measuring the quantity of the currency on the X axis...

* Demand for currency (base currency):
	* as price of base currency falls, demand by foreigners (reflected in quantity in x axis) increase.
	* hence, downward sloping.
* Supply of a currency (base currency):
	* as the amount of base currency supplied increases as the price of it increases (as base currency increases in value, the price of foreign goods decreases)
	* hence upward sloping curve.
* Equilibrium exchange rate
	* the rate at which the quantity of AUD supplied to the market is equal to the demand for AUD.



### Factors influencing exchange rate movements

* Relative (Base to terms currency) inflation rates
	* if the inflation rate for USD is higher than AUD, then...
		* Supply of AUD:
			* the value of USD decreases, so US goods cost more USD to buy, thus expensive. Australians don't want to convert their AUD to USD, so the supply of AUD decreases.
		* Demand for AUD:
			* since US goods are more expensive, Americans want to switch to the cheaper Australian goods, and they need AUD to buy it, so the demand for AUD increases.
		* Since supply for AUD is decreasing and demand is increasing, the AUD will be worth more (its more valuable), so there is a net appreciation of the AUD.
* relative national income growth rates
	* if the national income growth rate of Australia is greater than US, then...
		* Supply of AUD:
			* since Australians are making more money, there is a greater appetite for imports, people have more purchasing power, so imports can only increase, and there's no reason for it to decrease. To import goods from US, Australians need USD, so they will want to exchange AUD for USD, so the supply increases.
		* Demand for AUD:
			* there is no direct relation, but there will potentially be more foreign investment into Australia because its growing at a fast rate, so for investors to invest in Australia, they need more AUD, so the demand for AUD increases (potentially) as well.
		* Since supply is increasing, AUD depreciates initially and perhaps gain ground as more foreign investment comes in. 
* relative interest rates (return)
	* if the interest rates in Australia is greater than interest rates in the US, then...
		* Supply of AUD:
			* more interest return in Australia means Australians don't want/need to convert their AUD to USD, so the supply of AUD decreases, potentially because there's no direct reason for Australians to not  want other imports.
		* Demand for AUD:
			* since there's higher interest rates in Australia, more Americans want to invest in Australian markets, and to do that, they need AUD, so the demand for AUD increases
		* Since supply is decreasing and demand is increasing, the net value of AUD increases.
* exchange rate expectations
	* if the AUD to expected to fall, then...
		* Supply of AUD:
			* since AUD is expected to fall, more Australians will want to convert their AUD to USD (some other currency), and so the supply of AUD increases.
		* Demand for AUD:
			* since AUD is expected to fall, foreigners will not want to convert their money to AUD, so the demand for AUD decreases.
		* Since supply of AUD increases and the demand for it decreases, the expectation is realised and the value of AUD does fall, as expected. 
* government or central bank intervention.
	* this is more direct intervention of the govt. or central banks. They can have an impact on the deman or the supply or both. They can:
		* introduce direct policy altering relative inflation rates, income growth, interest rates.
		* intervene in interantional trade flows
		* intervene in foreign investment flows
		* directly intervene in the FX markets and buy/sell currencies.
