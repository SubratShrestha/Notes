# Chapter 5: Corporations issuing equity in the share market.

The Objective of financial mangement is to maximise the shareholder value and this can be done indirectly by doing things for the good of the company like taking better care of employees, etc.

Corporate mangers face important decisions in their attempt to max. shareholder wealth:

* Investment decision (**capital budgeting**): what assets do we invest in?
* Financing decision (**capital structure**): How do we fund the purchase of these assets? (through Debt or Equity).
* Liquidity management (working capital): How to best manage current assets and liabilities
* Dividend policy decision: How to retain and/or distribute profits. 



## Capital Budgeting (Investment decision)

Corporation first determines the assets in which it will invest funds in acc. to organisational objectives.

ex. Real assets (plants or equipment), or financial assets (equitites or bonds). 

There also needs to be competing investment alternatives (otherwise its time to assess the work of the managers because they are the ones that look at investment decisions/alternatives), and these alternatives should be evaluated on basis of shareholder wealth maximisation.



Before getting into quantifying the contributions of an investment, we should know:

* $$
	present\ value=\frac{CF}{(1+i)^t}\\
	Price=\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{CF}{(1+i)^t}
	$$

	

The two important measures used to **quantify** the contribution of an investnment:

* **NPV (Net Present Value) (calculation qs)**
	* the difference b/w the **present value** of cashflows and the **cost** of the investment.
	* so its just price - cost. So if NPV is -ve, it means costs more than it returns, reduces value of company and if NPV is +ve, it will return more than it costs, and it will increase value of company.
* **IRR (Internal Rate of Return) (concept qs)**
	* This is the required rate of return when NPV = 0. (let NPV = 0 and figure out  `i` or `r`).
	* Accept the investment if the IRR > required rate of return.

* something to keep in mind is that NPV and IRR both are influenced heavily by the accuracy of the forecasted cash flows, because while the cost of the asset is well known, what it will return is "expected". They are also influenced bu the discount rate which is the rate of return for obvious reasons.



Ex. A company is currently considering whether it should outlay \$500,000 for a machine that will have a useful life of 5 years. The forecast net cash flows from using the machine are \$150,000 each year for the next 5 years with no residual value at the end. What is the NPV of this project, given the required rate of return is 10%.
$$
P = \sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{CF}{(1+i)^t} = \sum_{t=1}^{5}\frac{150,000}{(1+0.1)^t}\\
= 568,618.01541\\
C = 500,000\\
NPV = P-C = 68,618.01541
$$


## Capital Structure (Financing decision)

Relates to the question of how should a business investment be funded. What is the capital structure used to fund the firm's business acts.?

The most imp. financing decision is choosing b/w **debt** and **equity**.

 The main financial objective of any business is to have positive **returns** with an acceptable amount of **risk**. Returns are generated from the net cash flows of a business and Risk is the uncertainty or variability of expected cash flows and its derived from **Business and Financial risk**.



### Business Risk

The level of business risk depends on the type of operations of the business. This is in some sense in the business's hands.

These are exposures that a firm might have that could impact the day to day operations of the org. like:

* failure of computer systems
* industrial actions of personnel
* sectoral growth rates
* market share
* aggressiveness of competitors
* competence of management and workforce.



### Financial Risk

The exposure to factors that impact the value of assets, liabilities and cash flows. These are in some sense out of the hands of the business, of course these can be managed in some sense with proper risk management tools but by large, the underlying risk is beyond the hands of the business because the business has no control over things like adverse interest rates, that's something the market is causing.

The level of financial risk is limited by security holders (debt and equity) like:

* Interest rate risk: risk of adverse movements in interest rates.
* Foreign exchange risk: risk of adverse movements in exchange rates.
* Liquidity risk: risk of insufficient cash in the short term.
* Credit risk: risk of default or untimely payments by debtors
* Capital risk: risk of insufficient shareholder funds to meet capital growth needs or absorb abnormal losses.
* Country risk: risk of financial loss due to currency devaluation or inconvertibility.
