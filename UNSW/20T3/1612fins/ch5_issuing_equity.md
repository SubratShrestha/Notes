# Chapter 5: Corporations issuing equity in the share market.

The Objective of financial mangement is to maximise the shareholder value and this can be done indirectly by doing things for the good of the company like taking better care of employees, etc.

Corporate mangers face important decisions in their attempt to max. shareholder wealth:

* Investment decision (**capital budgeting**): what assets do we invest in?
* Financing decision (**capital structure**): How do we fund the purchase of these assets? (through Debt or Equity).
* Liquidity management (working capital): How to best manage current assets and liabilities
* Dividend policy decision: How to retain and/or distribute profits. 



## Investment decision (Capital Budgeting)

Corporation first determines the assets in which it will invest funds in acc. to organisational objectives.

ex. Real assets (plants or equipment), or financial assets (equitites or bonds). 

There also needs to be competing investment alternatives (otherwise its time to assess the work of the managers), and these alternatives should be evaluated on basis of shareholder wealth maximisation.

The two important measures used to **quantify** the contribution of an investnment:

* NPV (Net Present Value).
* IRR (Internal Rate of Return).
