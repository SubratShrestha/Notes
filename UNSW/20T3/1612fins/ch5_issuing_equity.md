# Chapter 5: Corporations issuing equity in the share market.

The Objective of financial mangement is to maximise the shareholder value and this can be done indirectly by doing things for the good of the company like taking better care of employees, etc.

Corporate mangers face important decisions in their attempt to max. shareholder wealth:

* Investment decision (**capital budgeting**): what assets do we invest in?
* Financing decision (**capital structure**): How do we fund the purchase of these assets? (through Debt or Equity).
* Liquidity management (working capital): How to best manage current assets and liabilities
* Dividend policy decision: How to retain and/or distribute profits. 

# Capital Budgeting (Investment decision)

Corporation first determines the assets in which it will invest funds in acc. to organisational objectives.

ex. Real assets (plants or equipment), or financial assets (equitites or bonds). 

There also needs to be competing investment alternatives (otherwise its time to assess the work of the managers because they are the ones that look at investment decisions/alternatives), and these alternatives should be evaluated on basis of shareholder wealth maximisation.



Before getting into quantifying the contributions of an investment, we should know:

* $$
	present\ value=\frac{CF}{(1+i)^t}\\
	Price=\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{CF}{(1+i)^t}
	$$

	

The two important measures used to **quantify** the contribution of an investnment:

* **NPV (Net Present Value) (calculation qs)**
	* the difference b/w the **present value** of cashflows and the **cost** of the investment.
	* so its just price - cost. So if NPV is -ve, it means costs more than it returns, reduces value of company and if NPV is +ve, it will return more than it costs, and it will increase value of company.
* **IRR (Internal Rate of Return) (concept qs)**
	* This is the required rate of return when NPV = 0. (let NPV = 0 and figure out  `i` or `r`).
	* Accept the investment if the IRR > required rate of return.

* something to keep in mind is that NPV and IRR both are influenced heavily by the accuracy of the forecasted cash flows, because while the cost of the asset is well known, what it will return is "expected". They are also influenced bu the discount rate which is the rate of return for obvious reasons.



Ex. A company is currently considering whether it should outlay \$500,000 for a machine that will have a useful life of 5 years. The forecast net cash flows from using the machine are \$150,000 each year for the next 5 years with no residual value at the end. What is the NPV of this project, given the required rate of return is 10%.
$$
P = \sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{CF}{(1+i)^t} = \sum_{t=1}^{5}\frac{150,000}{(1+0.1)^t}\\
= 568,618.01541\\
C = 500,000\\
NPV = P-C = 68,618.01541
$$

# Capital Structure (Financing decision)

Relates to the question of how should a business investment be funded. What is the capital structure used to fund the firm's business acts.?

The most imp. financing decision is choosing b/w **debt** and **equity**.

 The main financial objective of any business is to have positive **returns** with an acceptable amount of **risk**. Returns are generated from the net cash flows of a business and Risk is the uncertainty or variability of expected cash flows and its derived from **Business and Financial risk**.



## Business Risk

The level of business risk depends on the type of operations of the business. This is in some sense in the business's hands.

These are exposures that a firm might have that could impact the day to day operations of the org. like:

* failure of computer systems
* industrial actions of personnel
* sectoral growth rates
* market share
* aggressiveness of competitors
* competence of management and workforce.



## Financial Risk

The exposure to factors that impact the value of assets, liabilities and cash flows. These are in some sense out of the hands of the business, of course these can be managed in some sense with proper risk management tools but by large, the underlying risk is beyond the hands of the business because the business has no control over things like adverse interest rates, that's something the market is causing.

The level of financial risk is limited by security holders (debt and equity) like:

* Interest rate risk: risk of adverse movements in interest rates.
* Foreign exchange risk: risk of adverse movements in exchange rates.
* Liquidity risk: risk of insufficient cash in the short term.
* Credit risk: risk of default or untimely payments by debtors
* Capital risk: risk of insufficient shareholder funds to meet capital growth needs or absorb abnormal losses.
* Country risk: risk of financial loss due to currency devaluation or inconvertibility.



## Debt to Equity Ratio

D/E ratio is ratio of funds contributed by shareholders (equity) to funds borrowed (debt).

Its one of the first things investors look at before investing because it indicates the risk of being unable to meet interest due and principal repayments associated with use of debt, ex. risk of insolvency.

There's no ideal D/E ratio, it depends on the company and the industry the company is involved in. The factors influencing D/E ratio are:

* Industry norms
* Historic levels of firm's ratio
* Limits imposed by lenders through loan covenants (conditions/restrictions on borrower and specified in loan contract).
* Management's assessment of firm's capacity to service debt (can the company repay debt if it goes with debt)

**Gearing ratio = perc. of firm's total funding provided by debt.**



## No Liability vs. Limited Liability companies

### Ordinary Shares: Limited liability companies (most well known companies)

* ordinary shares are major source of equity funding
* shareholders have voting rights at general meetings
* shares usually sold fully paid or can be partly paid on contributing basis or paid by instalment receipt
* shareholder's liability is limited to the price of fully paid shares
* partly paid shareholders have contractual obligation to pay the remaining amount when it is called or due



### Ordinary Shares: No liability companies

* used for highly speculative ventures
* shares issued as partly paid
* shareholders may decide not to meet future calls, in which case they forfeit the partly paid shares.
* ex. mining or oil companies (highly speculative - don't know if something will be found for sure and so investors don't want fully paid shares)



# Equity funding for Listed Companies.

Different ways of raising equity and the different types of equity.

**Different ways to raise Equity:**

* IPO - Initial Public Offering
* Additional ordinary shares
	* Rights issue, placements, takeover issues, dividend reinvestment schemes 

**Types of Equity:**

* Preference shares
* Quasi-equity: convertible notes, options, warrants



## Ways to raise Equity.

The obvious one is through IPOs but since a corporation is meant to last forever, they will need more funding than the ones issued through IPO. These are the different ways a corp. may do that.



### Rights Issue

* This is the issue of Ordinary Shares to **existing** shareholders.
* These "rights" are issued at a discount to the current share price
	* since the corp. has already IPO'd, there are shares floating around in the secondary markets at some price, if these rights are issued at a price that >= the price of shares in secondary market, nobody would buy (they'd just buy it off secondary), so to make them more lucrative, they are issued at a discount to current share price.
* Different factors affecting the issue price:
	* Cash flow requirements (how much equity they need to raise)
	* projected earnings flows from the new investments funded by the rights issue (what the company wants to use the funding for - if its an amazing investment where NPV >> 0, then the rights issue price can be high because investors will realize the value of the investment the company will be making)
	* cost of alternative funding sources (what the other choice is - if say the company is on the verge of breaching a loan covenant that specifies a max D/E ratio, then the only choice the corp. has is to raise equity, since there's no other choice, the price of rights issue must be lower).
* They are issued pro-rata. This means that they are issued in proportion to the amount of shares a shareholder already owns.
	* say A owns 10 shares (worth \$100 each) of Company C, if the company C issues a 1:2 or 1 for 2 rights issue, the company allows A to buy 5 more shares at a below market price of say \$70 (but since there are more shares in circulation of C's shares, there is a dilution in the value of each share, so A's 15 shares may now be worth \$90 a share, this is the ex-rights price, and its the market's reaction to the discount).
* Two types of Rights issues:
	* Renounceable - shareholder may sell their right
	* Non-renounceable - shareholder right may not be sold



### Placements

* Additional **new** ordinary shares are issued directly to **selected** investors (institutions and individuals).
* The corp. is not req. to register a prospectus (a document with a lot of info like the company history, management biographies, financial statements, best and worst case scenarios of company performance, and any other info that can help an investor make an informed decision. This document is required in order to offer shares to any investor, and takes a lot of time and money to make) because its just selected investors, but a memorandum of some info must be prepared.
* The min. amt. is \$500,000 and it must be to not more than 20 participants (selected investors), this depends on the exchange but it will be around these values.
* The market price discount cannot be excessive.
* This method allows for smaller discounts and a shorter time frame than issuing rights.
* Corp. must be cautious though, since doing this creates more shares and so the value of each share will fall (diluted value) and this will affect the non-participating, existing shareholders.
