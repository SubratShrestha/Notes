# Week 3 case study: Doors

## Air new zealand

* random drug and alcohol test is good
* co pilot (first officer) left flight deck for comfort break before having coffee with a crew member in the gallery area.
	* surely the captain was aware of who the co-pilot was with
* captain did not respond because it was from a cabin crew member and he was a approaching navigational waypoint 
	* why was the cabin crew member making the call in the first officer's place?
	* the captain should've listened to what the cabin crew member had to say because any number of things could've been going wrong and needed the captain's attention
* the first officer was concerned so he used an alternative entry to gain access.
* captain taken off duty for 2 weeks and co-pilot for 1 week
	* this is good, they clearly need more training
	* a bigger issue arises when you think about how they did these things despite receiving so much training beforehand. There could be a lot of pilots and co-pilots that could be lacking in the same area
	* they should be re evaluating the training new pilots receive.



## Germanwings captain locked out

* captain left the cockpit mid-flight to use the restroom
* when he returned, he found the co-pilot had barricaded himself inside and sent plane into descent
* sounds from inside the cockpit suggest the co-pilot was alive and well.
	* again, the training new pilots receive needs to be re evaluated because examples like this suggest someone who is clearly unfit to fly a plane is getting to do so
	* routine psychological analysis should also be a consideration as people change over time
* captain had used an axe/crowbar to try and force the door to open but failed to gain access
	* there should definitely be a way for a captain to forcefully gain access to the cockpit in emergency scenarios like this. The article doesn't mention how the co-pilot was able to barricade himself in the cockpit because if it was a physical block to the door, then there can't be many ways to gain access.



## AirIndia Jammed door

* On a flight, the captain left the control room for the restroom and found the door jammed
* efforts from the co-pilot from the inside of the room also failed
* luckily the co-pilot was skilled enough to divert the plane and land safely by himself
* the door was fixed on the ground and the plane continued its journey
	* was flying the same plane really the best idea? What if the door jammed again or something else went wrong? 
	* Because the plane clearly either passed safety checks with flaws or a safety check wasn't comprehensive enough. 
	* Either way the plane is unsafe to fly and shouldn't have been used again.



## AirIndia Stewardesses

* On a flight, both the pilot and co-pilot took a 40min break from the cockpit and left two stewardesses in charge of the plane
	* these people were definitely not fit to be in charge of the plane themselves if they left two untrained people in control of the plane
	* stewardesses know a lot about planes and emergency situations but they definitely lack the training to be able to fly a plane themselves
* one of the stewardesses turned the auto-pilot off and they pilots rushed back to their seats
	* the pilots definitely need more training and need to understand that there are hundreds of other people on the plane that they are responsible for
* the planes have been grounded since the beginning of the year due to issues like fuel leaks, cracked cockpit windows, brake problems, electrical fires, and overheating batteries
* despite this, the Civil Minister suggests the planes would resume flying by the end of May
	* is that enough time to train and retrain the pilots and have safety checks and rechecks for the above issues?



## Miracle on the Hudson

* plane from New York departed the airport and soon struck a flock of canadian geese
* both engines lost power and began to lose altitude
	* in the pictures that follow, there's one where someone is firing a non-lethal pyrotechnic round to disperse birds from the runway
	* ideally, this should've been done before the plane had to fly
* pilot knew there were no airports nearby and made the decision to glide the plane over the Hudson River
	* its very fortunate that the pilot was highly skilled and could land the plane on the river safely
	* despite that, this is a situation that shouldn't have happened in the first place
	* fortunately nobody was harmed, and this is what makes this situation a great learning opportunity and this kind of thing is likely to never happen again



## EgyptAir Flight 990

* flight took off from Kennedy Airport in the middle of the night, climbed 33000 feet and flew normally for half an hour and then suddenly started descending into the Atlantic Ocean
* rumoured that the crew said nothing to air-traffic control
* Air France swung over the ocean and reported nothing
* Later, a Merchant Marine training ship spotted the debris and reported it
* There were no survivors 

* In the conversation with William Langewiesche, he mentions

	* the 767 has flight control that provide the pilot with smooth and conventional responses.

	* normally operated on autopilot, but can also be flown by hand and even if a pilot lets go entirely, the plane sails on until it dips a wing and starts getting into gentle descent

	* if the engine is left idle or shut off, the plane becomes a glider

	* plane has excellent visibility, a minialist cockpit and can easily be managed by a two-person crew or even by 1 pilot

	* biggest problem is likely to be boredom

		

	* Not idiot-proof however, and because of its size, piloting it requires anticipation, mental clarity and understanding of the systems.

	* in non-ordinary situations, maintaining control needs firm action and arms

* When the first news came out of the crash, it was hard to imagine a pilot that could've done that with the 767 and have made no attempts at distress calls

* total electrical failure was unlikely and a fire would've given them time to make calls

* either the pilots were extremely busy or incapacitated from the start or something had gone horribly wrong with the plane

	

* mentions divides that lie between nations that react well to accidents and those that don't 

	* first req. is a matter of national will and to attempt to find what happened 
	* second req. is the need for people in aftermath to maintain even tempers and open minds

* there was an "active" crew to handle first and last hours and a "cruise crew" to montior autopilot

* all 4 were in Pennsylvania Hotel and were there for several days before the flight

* dispatcher rode on bus with the pilots and reported them as "normal"

* flight was on the runway at 1:12am and because of low traffic, communication with control tower was relaxed

* plane lifted off at 1:20am and leveled off at 1:44 as scheduled

* the plane and controller had a few usual words and the controller, having little on her plate, left her station for 6 mins, a reasonable interval, when the flight went down

* a computer captured what she would have seen. A very dramatic descent rate which the computer thought it was false and showed "XXXX". 

* flight kept reporting location for another minute and half indicating that the dive must have dramatically slowed or stopped and that the plane was still airborne

* When contact was lost, the computers couldn't find a correlation between the plan and what was actually happening. This is when the controller noticed and tried to contact the pilots

* she called air-defence radar facility and other air-traffic control centers to see if someone was in contact

* eventually contact Air France for overflight



* Since the crash was in international waters, Egypt could lead but realistically didn't have the resources, so they called the White House who then called the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate
